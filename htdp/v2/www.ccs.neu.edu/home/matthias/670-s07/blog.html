 will determine your IP number so that I can fire up my players to look for
 your port. Show up 5-10 minutes early so that you have plenty of time to
 get things to run.

 The embedded <code>&lt;END&gt;</code> text causes problems if you base the

<h3>On Trusting Players</h3>

<p>
 After watching the code walks yesterday and after receiving several
 inquiries on "trusting players", I have decided to provide some 
 additional design suggestions. 
</p>

<p>
 When a Project specification requests that you check the player's
 actions for attempted cheating, you definitely may <em>not</em> assume
 that players are trustworthy. You can't trust the player's hand; its
 designer may have added code to add cards in between turns. You can't
 trust the player's scoring of course; why not add a few points here and
 there while the "dealer" isn't looking. So no, don't trust the player for
 anything. Just imagine an open competition where friends and classmates
 program to the same interface and plug in players with the only goal of
 winning the Squadron Scramble tournament at all costs. 
</p>

<p>
 When a Project specification requests that you develop an automated
 Squadron Scramble player with a decent strategy, then imagine yourself
 playing the game -- with the information that you get through the 
 specified interface. Is it useful to keep track of your score? Is it
 useful to keep track of your discards? Your attacks? The discards of the
 rest of the players? In other words, does it help your planning efforts if
 you know that almost all cards have been discarded, i.e., you're nearing
 the end of a battle? Well, if it is, your automated player should keep
 track of these items.

These sound like great suggestions for future extensions. For now, your

something that could conceivably happen in real life.

<p><font color="red">
Since the player can inspect the entire stack during a turn, the answer is
yes. Can it see cards that are played and disappear between turn n and turn

<p>
Are they queued for a turn (and dealt a fresh 7 once they're reached) or
are they forced to wait for the next battle before entering? I could make
arguments for either approach.

<p><font color="red">
No.

4. When a player is caught cheating what happens to their hand? Placed

 As you may have noticed, by this time in the semester, I leave it to you
 to organize your classes and methods. In a sense this is 213/370 material
 and you're capable of designing/implementing it. As you do so, keep in
 mind today's hint, i.e., Tester and Administrator are really one
 conceptual unit. So you can create one huge method, but then it becomes
 difficult to create internal unit tests. Or you can create two methods
 plus one that combines them; in this case, you need to figure out where to
 keep all the state. Choose wisely.

As part of grading, I ran everyone's harness against a very simple test
case (based on one of those used for the test fest).  The actual input was

<p>
In this stage, I was only checking whether your harness completed the test
case, not whether it produced the expected results.  So, if your feedback
report indicates that your harness ran successfully against this input,
this means only that it did not crash, and that it produced output that
looks vaguely syntactically valid given the project's specification.  This
statement does <em>not</em> guarantee that your system performed correctly
against the test case.
</p>

<p>
Also, many teams lost a point for not documenting that the fourth argument
to <code>playOneTurn</code> means: is it all of the discarded squadrons, or
only the bombers?  This was indeed up to you for this project, so you could
choose either.  Of course, your Administrator's client needs to know, so
your choice needs to be documented in the Administrator interface.
Further, your use of this argument must be consistent with its description:
since <code>Turn</code>'s constructor expects a list of the other players'
discarded bombers as its 4th argument, then if you define
<code>playOneTurn</code> to accept a list of <em>all</em> discarded
squadrons, then you have to filter it accordingly before creating the
turn.

The answer is that this is <em>not</em> in the spirit of the assignment
which says that "[t]he goal of these contracts is to prevent ill-behaved
players from crashing the server or from upsetting its basic internal
invariants." In this case, a bad test case designer would crash the test
harness, and that's not what you wish to test. Instead you want to guard
against this.

<li>
  cd to Project6 or Project7, as appropriate.

Four remarks on Project 9:

<li>
  Ventz discovered an incomplete sentence in the problem statement. That's
  fixed.
</li>
<li>
  I have fixed the IO3 part, as discussed in class. For a regular
  <code>esac</code> case, your harness for the administrator must produce
  the specified outputs. For a <code>TIMING</code> case, it must send back
  a <code>TIMING</code> response and for a <code>CONTRACT</code> it must

  I contemplated the requested change to <code>TIMING</code> cases, i.e.,

  recommend keeping it short. 
</li>
<li>
 Robyn asked an interesting question after class. Suppose you are
 specifying a <code>TIMING</code> case, but your second message is a
 request for too many cards from the stack. Which of these two violations
 should we expect? There are two answers: 
<ol>
<li>
 A timing error can only be discovered if the execution of a second request
 for cards is about to execute. Before your program can do this, however,
 your contract system must determine that the second call is
 legitimate. During this phase, it will discover a problem with the "entry"
 part of the behavioral contract (too many cards requested) and signal a
 <code>CONTRACT</code> error. The timing error will never be discovered. 
</li>

 You should ponder the following question then: Is the testing language of
 Project 9 rich enough to express this case?

Also, concerning project 6, he adds: 
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The test cases that you write should be placed in
      <code>Tests/Project6</code>; the <code>Tests</code> directory should
      be at top-level within your submission directory.  (That is,
      <code>Tests</code> should be a sibling of <code>README</code>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Each test case should be stored in a separate file, with the
      <code>.xml</code> extension, and a filename that suggests the purpose
      of the test case.  <strong>DO NOT PUT SPACES IN THE TEST CASE
      FILENAMES.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      You may put other files in this directory (e.g., notes to yourself
      about the test cases), but they must not have <code>.xml</code>
      extensions.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      For task 1, you must include a <code>run-harness</code> script that
      will start your test harness (<em>not</em> your test-case
      administrator).  This script is subject to the same requirements as
      your other scripts.  Further, it must expect <em>no</em> command-line
      arguments (optional arguments for your own purposes are fine), and it
      must perform no input-output beyond that specified by the project.
    </p>

    <p>
      This script should run a single test case, which it reads from stdin,
      write the test's output to stdout, and then terminate.
    </p>

    <p>
      In most cases, this script will simply start your test harness.
      (Since a Unix child process, by default, inherit its parent's open
      file descriptors, your test harness will have the same stdin/stdout
      as the script.)
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      If you attempt Task 2, your <code>run</code> script must accept one
      command-line parameter, the name of the test case to run.  (You may
      support additional parameters if you desire, as long as they are not
      required.)

 Richard asked me to post <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/670-s07/Blog/zz-notes.html">some guidelines about
 submitting code. </a>
</p>

<p>Here are answers to questions that we are receiving repeatedly: </p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Does the completes function take into account wildcards when determining complete squadrons?</li>

<li>... but a squadron must be at least 2 aircraft cards and at most 1 wildcard
  from the game rules.  Which spec should we follow?</li>

<li>For the deck constructor, by directory order of cards, do you mean that
  we actually import from the xml file and then just use the order of cards
  as they are in the index.xml file?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
The answer is that a squadron is a collection of three cards: at least one
is an airplane and one or two others are wildcards. Yes, the specs
contradict the original rules, i.e., your customer has changed his
(absent-mineded) mind. Oh, and all aircraft cards in a
squadron must have the same name.  

<p>Someone else also asked: 
<blockquote>For the deck constructor, by directory order of cards, do you
  mean that we actually import from the xml file and then just use the
  order of cards as they are in the index.xml file?
</blockquote>
And yes, you are to use the directory with an XML index file and images to
create the collection of <em>all</em> cards. You may consider this your
first deck, but recall that you also must provide a function for shuffling
the deck.

</div></blockquote></div><div><hr /><p><b>Tuesday, January 30th, 2007</b></p><blockquote><div time="1170204615">

<p>
 It is apparently not widely known that a squadron consists of the
 <em>same</em> kind of airplanes (i.e., airplanes with the same name in
 this game). Please take this into account. 
</p>

<p>
 Also I fixed two more small typo-level details in the specs.

Someone asked: 

<blockquote>
<p>Does this mean that we should have all static methods?  In the OO
course, we learned how to convert non-object-oriented signatures into
object-oriented methods by using the implicit 'this' for the first argument
in cases where the that argument was the object that the method belonged
to.</p>

<p>Is this correct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are NOT using an OO PL, you should implement the signature AS IS. </p>

<p>If you are using an OO PL, you should implement the signature IN THE
  SPIRIT OF 213 (or 370). In other words, you didn't just learn this in
  370 (OO), you grew up with this from the very first day at NU.</p>

<p>
The signatures are specified in a true-and-only OO manner. They specify
that the first argument is THIS or SELF and the remaining arguments are the
arguments of a method. I don't want to force people, however, to use an OO
language, which is why I allow for this much variance. Otherwise you are to
implement the signature as-is, especially the state-less part.

<h3>A News Story</h3>

<p><a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Disjoint_Twins.aspx">Disjoint Twins</a></p>
<p>Thursday, January 25, 2007 (205 Comments)</p>
<p>by Alex Papadimoulis</p>
 
<p>I'd imagine that there's a lot involved with bringing a new person into
  this world. No, no -- I don't mean that part, I mean the whole paperwork
  side of things. There's Social Security to set up, a .name domain to
  register, birth certificate, insurance -- especially insurance. With all
  those people feigning pregnancy and labor just to get a stay at the
  hospital and a complimentary "It's a Boy!" balloon, insurers need to be
  extra certain that childbirth claim resulted in a real child.</p> 

<p>As the recent father of twin babies, Philip B. was relieved to learn
  that his employer's benefit provider, Sun Life Canada, made the insurance
  process really simple. Adding the little ones on the plan required no
  more than a phone call to provide birth dates, names, and that sort of
  thing. All seemed so easy, until the customer service rep realized what
  Philip was trying to do: "I'm sorry sir, but we need a different birth
  date for each of your kids."</p> 

<p>"Uhh, er," Philip stuttered, rather puzzled, "they're twins? They were
  both born on the seventh of May, so they actually do have the same birth
  date."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I understand," she said, "but our system cannot handle two
  people with the same last name born in the same month of the same year on
  the same plan."</p>

<p>Philip's jaw dropped. He inquired some more with the CSR to try
  understand how such a technical limitation could occur. It turns out that
  a new version of their software was installed that tracked each person's
  budget based on their last name, plan number, and month/year of
  birth. Hence, having two people born in the same month and year on one
  plan would cause all claims to be booked against one of the two's budget,
  risking a premature budget exhaustion.</p> 

<p>We can only hope that, by now, Sun Life has corrected their new
  insurance system to account for the unfathomable concept of twins. But as
  of this day, for insurance purposes, Philip's kids are born a month
  apart, one on April 7 and the other on May 7. That, apparently, is much
  more fathomable.</p>

<b>SVN Project Structure:</b>

<p>
 If we specify a directory name or filename in the SVN repository, your
 turnin tree must match that name *exactly* -- including case and
 punctuation.
</p>

<p>
  In the notes for lecture 3, we stated that each project statement would
  contain the name of the directory that you are to create within the
  <code>turnin</code> directory.  For simplicity, we will simply use the
  pattern established by the previous assignment: <code>Project2</code>,
  <code>Project3</code>, <code>Project4</code>, and so on.
</p>

<p>
  For project 3 and forwards, your <code>README</code> file and the
  required scripts (<code>compile</code>, etc.) must appear at top-level
  within the project directory.  You may structure your code any way you
  like within the project directory, but your <code>README</code> file must
  contain a roadmap, as discussed in lecture 3.  So, if you choose to use
  Java, you may create the directory structure corresponding to your code's
  packages.
</p>

<p>
  Any memos should appear within a <code>Memos/Project<i>N</i></code>
  directory.  The <code>Memos</code> directory must appear at top-level
  within the main project directory.  (Rationale: we specify that the
  project name must appear twice within the path so that you can keep all
  of the memos you write to us in your <code>work</code> directory, and
  keep them well-organized, and we can find the memos easily when we
  grade.)
</p>

<p>
  Finally: In lecture 3, we asked that your <code>README</code> file
  include a list of which parts you attempted.  Since this is information
  is to be included on the cover page that you submit, you do not need to
  include this in your <code>README</code>.
</p>

<p>
  To summarize:
<pre>
<code>
  ProjectN

   +---- Memos
   |     |
   |     +---- ProjectN

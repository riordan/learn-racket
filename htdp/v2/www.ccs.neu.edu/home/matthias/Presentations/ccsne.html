<p>My team and I have developed an alternative approach to the first-year
 courses on programming and computing.  Unlike conventional approaches,
 ours focuses on designing programs in a systematic manner. The syntax of
 the chosen programming languages (both Java and Scheme) is only discussed
 as needed to support design principles. Field tests with over 500 high
 schools and a dozen colleges have shown that the approach produces better
 students than conventional approaches that use a single language.  In
 several controlled studies, we could also show that students find our
 curriculum more appealing than the AP curriculum.
</p>

<p>In my talk, I will provide an overview of the project, especially its
 intellectual premises and principles. My goal is to encourage you to think
 about the first year in a different way. The old ones are of questionable
 value. If we want our beautiful discipline to survive, we must find a good
 way of teaching it.

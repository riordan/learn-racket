Since 1995 my research team (PLT) and I have been working on a programming
 language for creating programming languages---small and large. Our code
 base includes a range of languages, and others contribute additional
 languages on a regular basis. PLT programmers don't hesitate to pick our
 lazy dialect to implement one module and to link it to a strict language
 for another module in the same system. Later they may even migrate one of
 the modules to the typed variant during some maintenance task.
<p>
An expressive macro system is one key to this riches of languages. Starting
 with the 1986 introduction of hygienic macros, the SCHEME world has worked
 on turning macros into tools for creating proper abstractions. The first
 part of my talk will briefly describe this world of modern macros and its
 key attributes: hygiene, referential transparency, modularity of macros,
 phase separation, and macro specification. 
<p>
The second part of my talk will focus on how to equip LISP-like languages
 with a sound type systems and that will illustrate the second key idea,
 namely, monitoring the interactions between different languages. Our
 approach to type systems allows programmers to stick to their favorite
 LISP idioms. It mostly suffices to annotate functions and structures with
 type declarations during maintenance work. To ensure the soundness of this
 information even when higher-order values flow back and forth between
 typed and untyped modules, module boundaries are automatically equipped
 with software contracts that enforce type-invariants at all levels.

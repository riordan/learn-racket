<blockquote width=60%>
Over the last 15 years, we have experienced a programming language
 renaissance. Numerous scripting languages have become widely used in
 industrial and open-source projects. They have supplemented the existing
 mainstream languages---C++ and Java---and, in contexts such as systems
 administration and web programming, they have started to play a dominant
 role.
<p>
While each scripting language comes with its own philosophy, their
 designers share an antipathy to types. As a result, these languages come
 without a static type system. Most script developers initially welcome
 this freedom, but soon discover that the lack of a type system deprives
 them of an essential maintenance tool.
<p>
My keynote explains my team's approach to equip such languages with a type
 system. The goal of our work is to empower programmers so that they can
 gradually enrich scripts with types on a module-by-module basis as they
 perform maintenance work on the system. Naturally, we wish to ensure type
 soundness so that the type annotations are meaningful, and we wish to
 accommodate the programming idioms of the original language in order to
 keep the overhead of type enrichment low.

<p>
In the world of Racket, software systems consist of interoperating
 components in different programming languages. These languages may provide
 the full functionality of Racket, or they may support a domain-specific
 notation.  Naturally, Racketeers construct languages as Racket components
 and compose them to create new languages.  This talk will present the
 ideas behind Racket: language-specific components, the composition of
 components, and, most importantly, the rich support for building
 languages.

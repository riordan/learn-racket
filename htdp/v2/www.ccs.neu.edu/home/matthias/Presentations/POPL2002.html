This invited talk presents an overview of the TeachScheme! and DrScheme
 projects. The goal of the TeachScheme! project is to incorporate the
 principles of programming and programming languages into the introductory
 programming curriculum at the high school and college level. The goal of
 the DrScheme project is to produce a program development environment that
 supports the pedagogy and design principles of the TeachScheme!
 project. In turn, both projects raise interesting questions concerning the
 design of programming languages and the design principles behind large
 programs. The talk will indicate where and how our work on introductory
 programming led to interesting insights in these research areas.

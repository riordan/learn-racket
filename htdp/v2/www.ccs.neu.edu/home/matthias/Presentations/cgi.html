<blockquote width=60%>

<p>The programmer of an interactive CGI script (or servlet) faces a serious
 design constraint. When a script needs to query a consumer, it must
 produce a Web page and terminate. When the consumer submits a response,
 the server will invoke another script. In addition, a consumer can
 bookmark generated pages, switch back and forth between such pages, clone
 browser windows, and submit responses repeatedly and simultaneously. All
 of this requires the programmer to break a simple interactive program into
 many separate scripts and to communicate data between these scripts in an
 unnatural manner.

<p>My team and I have developed two approaches to overcome this
 problem. The first relies on the implementation of a special-purpose Web
 server that supports a scripting language with constructs for consumer
 interactions. Using these new constructs, a programmer can develop and
 test an ordinary interactive program, and the server takes care of the
 interactions between the program and the consumer. The second implements
 these new constructs as extensions to existing programming languages using
 well-established program transformation techniques from the functional
 world. Programmers can also use this second approach directly, without any
 tool support.

<p>We have tested both approaches. In this talk, I will demonstrate the
 problem, explain our two approaches, and discuss the advantages and
 disadvantages of each.

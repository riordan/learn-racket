<p>
Academics love functional programming, many practitioners fear it. But,
neither love nor fear are appropriate. Functional programming technology
comes with advantages and disadvantages, like all other technology. With
this talk, I will introduce functional programming, distinguish it from
functional programming languages, and explain the importance of both.
</p>

<p>
One key benefit of functional programming is its unrivaled clarity of
expression. In contrast to imperative programming, all communication
between distinct components uses explicit channels.  Hence it easy to test 
components, to compose them, and to validate them.
</p>

<p>
The requirement of explicit channels also means that both the programmer as
well as the compiler knows all dependencies. As a result, functional
programming creates numerous opportunities to exploit modern forms of
parallelism. For the programmer, explicit communication means a reduction
in race conditions; for the compiler, it means lowering the cost of
automatic parallelization.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least, functional programming languages provide many more
mechanisms for designing and implementing embedded domain-specific
programming languages. Such languages greatly facilitate collaboration with
domain experts and in principle, they enable compilers to produce much more
efficient code than for programs in full-fledged languages.

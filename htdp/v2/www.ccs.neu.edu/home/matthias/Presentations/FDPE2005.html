<p>Colleges and universities must expose their students of computer science to
 object-oriented programming (OOP) even if the majority of the faculty believes
 that OOP is not the proper programming paradigm for novices.  OOP is an
 important paradigm of thought, and OOP languages are widely used in commercial
 settings. Ignoring these facts means to ignore the students' needs.  </p>

<p>In the past, institutions that introduce functional programming first have
 explained object-oriented programming via closures and method-oriented
 dispatch.  Put differently, in such courses, students learn to implement
 objects, message passing, and delegation. They do not learn to design
 object-oriented programs. Although I firmly believe that our students benefit
 from such knowledge, I will argue that it is inappropriate as an introduction
 of object-oriented programming.  </p>

<p>My talk will instead present a novel approach to the first-year programming
 curriculum. Specifically, I will explain how a functional semester ideally
 prepares students for the true essence of object-oriented programming according
 to Alan Kay: the systematic construction of small modules of code and the
 construction of programs without assignment statements. Experience shows that
 these courses prepare students better for upper-level courses than a year of
 plain object-oriented programming. Initial reports from our students' co-op
 employers appear to confirm the experiences of our upper-level instructors. </p>

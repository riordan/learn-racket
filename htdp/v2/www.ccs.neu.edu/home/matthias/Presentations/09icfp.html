Functional programming languages ought to play a central role in
 mathematics education for middle schools (age range: 10--14).  After all,
 functional programming {\em is\/} a form of algebra and programming is a
 creative activity about problem solving. Introducing it into mathematics
 courses would make pre-algebra course come alive.  If input and output
 were invisible, students could implement fun simulations, animations, and
 even interactive and distributed games all while using nothing more than
 plain mathematics.
<p>
We have implemented this vision with a simple framework for purely
 functional I/O. Using this framework, students design, implement, and test
 plain mathematical functions over numbers, booleans, string, and
 images. Then the framework wires them up to devices and performs all the
 translation from external information to internal data (and vice
 versa)---just like every other operating system. Once middle school
 students are hooked on this form of programming, our curriculum provides a
 smooth path for them from pre-algebra to freshman courses in college on
 object-oriented design and theorem proving.

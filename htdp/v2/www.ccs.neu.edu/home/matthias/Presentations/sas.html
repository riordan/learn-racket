<p>
Over the past six years, my team has adapted static analyses for several
purposes, including compiler transformations and static debugging. All of
the tools have been used in research and teaching. My talk will first relay
our experiences, both positive and negative.  Based on this experience
report, I will then suggest some constraints on future research in this
area.

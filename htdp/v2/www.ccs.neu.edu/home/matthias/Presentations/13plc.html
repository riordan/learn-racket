At the 1999 opening workshop of PPS--Pierre-Louis Curien's new lab at Paris
7--I presented the first talk on higher-order contracts. Since then these
logical interface assertions on higher-order objects have become a subject
of intense study. In contrast to contracts for first-order values,
higher-order contracts pose challenging questions, mostly concerning their
semantics and their pragmatics. The former is about such questions as 
what these contracts mean and when are contracts satisfied; the latter
tries to answer the question whether blaming a specific component is
justified when a contract is violated. 

In this talk, I will show how my joint work with Pierre-Louis Curien on
observably sequential functions in the mid 1990s informed our search for a
semantics of higher-order contracts. The model has pleasing answers to many
questions. Even if it ultimately fails to explain all questions in this
realm, it has served as a guideline for many contract design questions for
the past ten years. To answer the question on pragmatics, we have to turn
to the pragmatics developed by Christos Dimoulas.

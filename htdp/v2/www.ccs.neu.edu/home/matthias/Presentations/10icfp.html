In 1995, my team and I decided to create an outreach project that would use
 our research on functional programming to change the K-12 computer science
 curriculum. We had two different goals in mind. On one hand, our novel
 curriculum should rely on mathematics to teach programming, and it should
 exploit programming to teach mathematics. All students---not just those
 who major in computer science---should benefit. On the other hand, our
 course should demonstrate that introductory programming can focus on
 program design, not just a specific syntax. We also wished to create a
 smooth path from a design-oriented introductory course all the way to
 courses on large software projects.
<p>
My talk presents a checkpoint of our project, starting with our major
 scientific goal, a comprehensive theory of program design. Our work on
 this theory progresses through the development of program design courses
 for all age groups. At this point, we offer curricular materials for
 middle schools, high schools, three college-level freshman courses, and a
 junior-level course on constructing large components. We regularly use
 these materials to train K-12 teachers, after-school volunteers, and
 college faculty; thus far, we have reached hundreds of instructors, who in
 turn have dealt with thousands of students in their classrooms.

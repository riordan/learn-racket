Over the past 15 years, my team and I have developed a computing curriculum
 that starts in middle school and goes all the way through the first
 software engineering course. We had two goals in mind. First, in middle
 school programming should be aligned with mathematics---it should
 demonstrate how much fun it can be to write down and then run
 mathematics. That way all students would benefit from the introductory
 course, even if they never take another course again. Second, once we had
 students hooked on programming, we wanted to teach them a systematic
 problem solving process. While teaching by example is necessary, it is
 impossible to rely on it exclusively; students invariably fail to grasp
 the implicit design lessons. Students should therefor see a method for
 designing programs that consists of well-defined generic steps and where
 each step produces checkable intermediate products.

<p>
In this talk I present the three major lessons of this projects. First we
 can turn mathematics into a fun programming exercise, if the language and
 its IDE support an arithmetic of images.  Second, no off-the-shelve
 professional language can truly support novice programmers. We need to
 specify and implement language subsets, ideally an entire hierarchy of
 them. Third, I will sketch some of the major elements of systematic
 program design. For the remainder of the talk I will briefly discuss some
 of our technical failures and challenges.

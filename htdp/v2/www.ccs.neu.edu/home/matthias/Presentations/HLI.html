<p>Programming languages bridge the gap between programmers and machines.  On
 one hand, programmers use the language as a mechanism for instructing a
 machine and for sharing ideas about computations with others. On the other
 hand, compilers and interpreters process programs according to the rules
 of the language. The symmetry suggests that programming language
 researchers pay equal attention to both halves: the human-language
 interface and the language-machine interface. Unfortunately, this is not
 true. While researchers have paid some attention to explaining syntax
 errors, type errors, and data flow properties, most research efforts focus
 on type systems, logics, semantics, compilation strategies, register
 allocation, instruction pipelining, memory locality, etc. In other
 words, work on the language-machine interface dominates work on the
 human-language interface.  The consequences are bad for both novices and
 experienced programmers. Novices struggle with an array of bewildering
 programming and programming language concepts from the very start;
 professionals who switch from one class of language to another often miss
 the point of the new language and its program design philosophy.

<p>Over the past eight years, my team and I have engaged in constructing a
 human interface to the Scheme programming language. Since a programming
 language is a complex logical artifact, the interface consists of three
 large components: a design philosophy with programming techniques; a
 series of increasingly powerful sublanguages of Scheme; and a programming
 environment that supports both. Experience with novice programmers suggest
 that this interface to Scheme provides a significantly smoother learning
 curve than conventional interfaces. 

<p>In my talk, I will present these components and suggest to develop this
 idea of a human-language interface into a general research area.

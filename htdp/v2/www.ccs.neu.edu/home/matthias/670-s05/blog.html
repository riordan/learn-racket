<p><b>Reminder:</b>Tomorrow is "aspect day", which means no class. Instead,
  you are to attend (at least) two of the presentations in Dodge Hall 450,
  between 1 and 5pm. For details, see below. The homework is due this
  coming Thursday (@ 12/noon), so get started today. 
</p>

<p>Over the last ten years, a new promising technology has emerged in academia
that industry is embracing quickly. The new technology, dubbed "aspects", was
co-invented at Northeastern and has a tremendous following in the northeast
corridor. Northeastern is jointly organizing a workshop with Brown to show case
this technology. Please attend two presentations on March 8 instead of class;
your homework for this week is to write a memo to your boss on the two talks,
outlining the two ideas and writing a brief evaluation paragraph. Specifics will
appear on the homework page soon.</p>

<br />
			Tuesday, March 8, 2005<br />
		 Northeastern University, Boston, MA<br />
				12-5pm<br />
</center>

<p>We invite you to participate in a free symposium on aspect-oriented
software development.  Our speakers are</p>

<blockquote>
  Kevin Sullivan, University of Virginia<br />
  Mario Sudholt, INRIA and Ecole des Mines de Nantes<br />
  Daniel Jackson, MIT<br />
  Robert Filman, NASA Ames Research Center<br />
</blockquote>

<p>They are authorities on various facets of this exciting topic; some
will promote it, while others will represent skeptical viewpoints. We
expect a lively, informative, and even provocative day.</p>

I have signed you up collectively. If you have time, I urge you to attend all
talks. It is rare to encounter such a strong collection of speakers from all
over the world in a private workshop for free.

<center><font color="red">The Final Code Walk</font></center>

<p><b>Final submission:</b> The code that you submit on Friday at 5:00pm is
  the code that you will present in your final code walk. You will present
  it on either a lab-style Windows computer or a lab-style Solaris (Unix)
  computer. To ensure that you can present and run your code, you must 
<ul>
<li>CC Alex on your final submission (see Web page for email address)</li>

<li>Specify in your email on which machine you want to present and run your
code</li>

<li>Plead your case with Alex to install software other than the one on the
 lab machines. If you really need such software, you should meet with Alex
 as soon as you can do prepare this installation. 
</li>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Final presentation:</b> Over the weekend you should prepare your
  final presentation of your entire project. The presentations will proceed
  as follows: 
<ul>
<li>You will demo your game. You will run your server; I will connect my
  players to your server.</li>

<li>You will give an overview of the project's goals, the software
  organization that you chose, the data representations, and how the pieces
  interact with each other.</li>

<li>During the Q&amp;A period, we will ask you specific questions about (i) the
  proxy architecture of your project and (ii) anything else that we might
  become interested in.
</li>
</ul>
 So come prepared to explain every aspect of the project.  
</p>

</div></div><div><p><b>Friday, November 21st, 2008</b></p><hr /><div>
Please take a look at the revised scoring policy for incomplete abbeys at
the end of the game in the <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/670-s05/Projects/caracasonne.html">Carcassonne</a>
description. We will give you full credit for either policy but for future
reference (and planning) you should take the revised version into account. 
</div></div><div><p><b>Friday, November 21st, 2008</b></p><hr /><div>

Sam TH and I will hold office hours on a by-appointment basis. Also, if you
need to see us spontaneously, check whether we are in the lab. If we are
around and have time, we are happy to discuss course matters with you. 

</div></div><div><p><b>Friday, November 21st, 2008</b></p><hr /><div>

<p>As announced in class today, you must find a new partner by the end of
the week. You and your new partner must choose one of the two code bases
that you worked on as the new code base. </p>

<p><font color="red">Action Item:</font> You must let Sam know via email by
  Friday midnight who your new partner is and which code base you will use
  from here on out. Failure to do so will cost you 10 points on the next
  assignment.

<p>The grading rubric for Project 4: </p>

<b>Task 1:</b> Here are the minimal answers:

<pre>
<font size="-1">
<code>
  (define admin&lt;%&gt; (interface () ))
  ;; because the admin doesn't have external 
  ;; stimuli for this task!

  (define player&lt;%&gt;
    (interface ()
      take-turn ;; turn&lt;%&gt; -&gt; Void
      ;; it's the player's turn

      score-and-token ;; Number Number -&gt; Void
      ;; the player has scored a point 
      ;; and receives some of the tokens back
      ))

  (define turn&lt;%&gt;
    (interface ()
      potential-locations-for-tile ;; -&gt; Listof[tile&lt;%&gt;]
      ;; given an index for a potential tile,
      ;;  compute a list of tiles
      ;; that could be placed into the graph

      place-tile ;; tile&lt;%&gt; -&gt; Void
      ;; _this_ turn places the given tile into the graph

      potential-locations-for-followers
	;; -&gt; Listof[(list tile&lt;%&gt; Position)]

      ;; compute the potential tile locations
      ;; and positions on these tiles
      ;; in _this_ graph where a follower could be placed

      place-follower ;; tile&lt;%&gt; Position -&gt; Void
      ;; this turn places the player's follower on t at p
      ))
</code>
</font>
</pre>

<p>If they deliver less, take off points in proportion. If they deliver
 more, take off points in proportion, unless they justify the extra entry
 points really well.</p>

<b>Task 2:</b> The only modification I could think of is this one:

<pre>
<font size="-1">
<code>
  (define admin-graph&lt;%&gt;
    (interface ()
      ...
      abbey-regions 
      ;; -&gt; Listof[(list Follower Number)]
      ;; compute who gets how many points 
      ;; for incomplete abbey regions
      ))
</code>
</font>
</pre>

<p>More and less is punished as above.</p>

<b>Task 3:</b> The 28 points are already distributed over the interfaces. 0 means
 they should recognize that the graph must implement _both_ interfaces.

<ul>
 <li>subtract 9 points if the code doesn't compile
 </li><li>otherwise subtract points for (1) missing methods that are specified in
 the interface 
 </li><li>for (2) badly implemented methods: missing purpose statement included
 </li><li>high-light but don't subtract points for missing tests for public
 methods</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Task 4:</b> If they describe the idea of "place and investigate for strategy"
 [i.e., backtracking] they get 3 points; otherwise 0. </p>

directions on the code walk to appear here soon.

Until further notice, please email the tar bundles for projects on the due date
and before the due time to Sam T-H. with 670 as the starting word in the subject
line.

People have raised two questions concerning the submission of project 2: 
<ol>
<li><em>Can we use zip files instead of tar files?</em> The answer is "no",
  you really need to turn in tar files. 

  <p>In general, it is terribly important for you to get to know a range of
  technologies---things I can't teach and your boss won't teach you but
  everyone will want you to know. Creating a tar bundle is one such thing.
  A rudimentary understanding of cvs (a version control system) is another
  one. Reading a newsgroup on a regular basis falls into the same
  category. See the <a href="index.html">homepage</a> for a
  motivation.</p>
</li>

<li><em>What are we to do about the diagrams?</em> You may either use plain
  text diagrams (aka ASCII art) or you can use the tool of your choice and
  generate a jpeg file. I haven't encountered any tool yet that doesn't
  output some graphics file format and finding a filter from that format to
  jpeg is usually a matter of googling.
</li>
</ol>

Can you post to the blog that <font color="red">anyone who submits

He is just horribly wrong about the use of
"their". Not graded means 0.

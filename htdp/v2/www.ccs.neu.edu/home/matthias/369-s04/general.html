      seminar course. You will get out of the course what you put in.</p><p><font color="red" font="italic">Work:</font> You will need to
      choose a set of three themes of your choice. For each theme, you will
      need to find a set of at least two and up to five papers (I will help
      as much as I can pointing you in the right direction); you will need
      to read those papers; you will need to digest them into an annotated
      bibliography; you will need to turn the central ideas of all the
      papers into a coherent lecture; and you will need to take notes for
      the discussions after these presentations. </p><p><font color="red" font="italic">Reading:</font> You will need to
         read a fair amount. <em>Reading</em> means working through a text,
         figuring out the key innovation in the paper, and making up and
         working through examples that help you understand the innovations.</p><p><font color="red" font="italic">Writing:</font> You will also need
         to write a fair amount. Specifically, you will develop an
         annotated bibliography for each theme that you work on. The
         annotations will take the form of conference referee reports.
         Each annotation will consist of approximately two paragraphs: one
         that summarizes the paper and one that evaluates the significant
         contributions of the paper from a historical perspective.</p><p><font color="red" font="italic">Presentation:</font> You will also
         need to give a presentation on each theme. A presentation should
         take approximately 40 minutes. Each presentation will be followed
         by a directed discussion of 15 minutes.  The presentation should
         present a background (where did they start from?) and the
         essential contributions of each paper in the theme.</p><p>To help you prepare the presentation and to help you evaluate the
      presentations of others, please read the following evaluation sheets:
	<center><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/369-s04/eval.ps">postscript</a>, <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/369-s04/eval.pdf">PDF</a></center></p><p><font color="red" font="italic">Pair-researchers and
      scribes:</font> Everyone will work with a partner. This partner is
      responsible for two things: (1) helping you prepare the presentation
      and (2) writing a transcript of the discussion that follows your
      presentations. <font color="red">It is critical that you arrange for
      a replacement if you must miss a session <em>well before</em> the
      meeting.</font></p><p><font color="red" font="italic">Grades:</font> The grades will
      consists of 12 components: one grade per annotated bibliography,
      two per presentation (presenter and partner), one per scribe
      session. Both the presenter and the partner will receive a grade for
      each presentation.</p></div></div></td></tr></table><hr width="80%" height="3" /><table width="80%" align="center"><tr><td align="left"><font size="-2">last updated on Tue Jun  9 22:21:18 EDT 2009</font></td><td align="right"><font size="-2">generated with <a href="http://www.plt-scheme.org/">PLT Scheme</a></font></td></tr></table></body></html>

  The class meets on Tuesdays and Fridays from 9:50am to 11:30am, 
  starting on September 7, 2012 and ending December 07, 2012.

  The course is schedule for <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/neuhome/aboutnortheastern/maps.html">International Village 022.</a></p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Grades</nbsp></font> 
 PhD students don't go to school to get grades. Try again.
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Prerequisites</nbsp></font> 
 The course will assume that you know how to design (recursive) programs
 (systematically) and that you have encountered inductive proofs in your
 undergraduate education. At Northeastern, most of the relevant material is
 covered in the freshman courses on programming and computing and logic in
 computing. In case you have doubts, consider reading the book below:
<blockquote>
  Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, Krishnamurthi. 
  <cite><a href="http://www.htdp.org/">How to Design Programs.</a></cite>
  MIT Press 2001.
 
  <br />
  Understanding the sections labeled "Designing ..." is a key to this course.
</blockquote>
 For a PhD student, "to read" means <em>to read and solve the
 exercises</em> and if you can't, read the section. -- The above is not the 
 only approach to explicit and systematic design of programs. It is quite
 possible that you have acquired the necessary background via alternative
 approaches. 
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Weekly Homework Assignment</nbsp></font> 

 The weekly assignments will serve to reinforce the technical
 material. Some problems will ask you to solve paper and pencil problems;
 for others you will use the PLT Redex modeling environment, which comes
 with the Racket programming language; and for yet others, you may have to
 program in your favorite programming language. 
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Mini-Project</nbsp></font> 

 In order to integrate what you have learned during the semester, you will
 work on a mini-project during the second half of the semester. I will
 propose topics for the mini-project after a couple of weeks. If you intend
 to get your PhD in programming languages, you are welcome to propose your
 own project; collect project ideas during the first few weeks as you get
 to know how the course works.
</p><p>
 You will present the results of your Mini-Project during the lecture
 time of the last (two) weeks of the semester. Your presentation should be
 an extension of your memo with your results translated into an oral
 format. You have 30 minutes for your presentation, 15 minutes per
 student. You will answer questions for around 10 minutes. This is similar
 to the common conference presentation constraint. 
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Work</nbsp></font> 

 You will work in pairs for the weekly assignments and the mini-project.
 The pairings will change over the course of the semester. For the
 mini-project you may choose your own partner, enrollment permitting. 

 PhD research isn't about individual work only; you must learn to
 collaborate with others. 
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Exams</nbsp></font> 
  We may have some. Perhaps not. See grades above. 
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Grades</nbsp></font> 
  Okay, okay. We will assign grades because some people will never
  understand that a PhD is all about "wanting to learn". 

  To a first approximation, the grades will be based on the results of some
  10 weekly assignment sets, each of which also counts for 5% of the final
  grade. The rest of the grade (approximately 50%) is based the pieces of
  the mini-project and their timely completion. If an exam or a pop quiz is
  called for, the mini-project will count for less.

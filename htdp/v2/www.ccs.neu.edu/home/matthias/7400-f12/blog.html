 The project proposals are graded. The average grade is 80% (a B+), with a
 range of 20/20 to 12/20. 
</p>

<p>
 The grade consists of four parts: content (6), English writing (12), looks
 (1) and "citation" (1). The last two are awarded for a precise
 specification of the paper that you use for your project and type setting
 style. I did not take off either of these two points, though two
 submissions got really close. Based on this experience, I will refine the
 project page to specify the format of the resubmission.
</p>

<p>
 The <strong>content</strong> grade awards three points for a concise,
 neutral, and correct summary of the paper. The proposal counts for an
 additional three points. A good proposal consists of two parts: a goal
 statement (<em>what</em>, specification) and an approach (<em>how</em>,
 implementation). A goal can come as an indirect question and its
 explanation [or as a conjecture and the reasoning that produced it]; an
 approach spells out which tools (software, mathematics, measurements) you
 will use and how you use them to answer the question [or validate the
 conjecture]. -- Few of you are in a position to work with conjectures, 
 which is why these sentence fragments are in brackets.

<p>
 The <strong>English writing</strong> grade judges memo organization,
 paragraph organization, sentence organization, grammatical correctness,
 and spelling.

This morning's email came with a pointer to
<a href="http://americanscience.blogspot.com/2012/10/embracing-and-communicating-uncertainty.html">a
blog on models and uncertainty</a> that I thought I should share with
you. After all, this course is primarily about turning undergraduates
(including MS students) into PhD-level researchers. 
</p><p>
 I consider the <em>the
 Modelers' Hippocratic Oath</em> (bottom of the blog) of particular
 interest. All too often, we forget that our models are highly inaccurate,
 given the true size and complexity of our programs and programming
 languages; our theorems about these models are not much more than a
 "testing effort" that ensures some basic validity; and our measurement
 efforts are not even fully repeatable at the precise data level. 
</p>

<p>
 In my opinion, all of the above applies to all other research areas within
 computer science as much as it applies to programming languages, and for
 the newer areas (almost all), it applies even more so.

 I graded problem 3 extremely leniently. If I had graded the proof idea
 according to my 'reading meter' for submissions to a conference, most
 submissions would have lost all points allocated for this problem. Here is a
 sample explanation: 
<blockquote>
 Every reduction step shrinks the size of the "state". Since the size
 cannot drop below 0, a reduction must be finite.
</blockquote>
 Such explanations must convey the basic idea, and they must be
 grammatically well-formed sentences. Good reviewers will catch problems
 with the former aspect, and really good reviewers will stomach bad
 sentences only if the ideas are overwhelmingly good.

 Assignment 6 is graded. The average grade is 82% (a B+), with a range of
 23/25 to 16/25. The key problems concerned reduction and standard
 reduction.

<p>
 The first problem called for restricting the <tt>==&gt;</tt> relation so that
 reductions would take place in the first statement of a block. To my
 surprise, a fair number of solutions did neither eliminate <tt>s_1

<p>
 The third problem called for the creation of a standard reduction relation
 for the reduction relation from problem 1. As the book and the lecture
 emphasized, the main idea is to restrict the contexts where <tt>==&gt;</tt>
 reductions can take place. So the only true modification called for was a
 change to the <tt>with</tt> clause; depending on your approach to problem
 1, you may have also had to extend the language so that the proper kinds
 of contexts would be available. -- I was lenient in grading this problem.

 Assignment 4 is graded. The average grade is 11/15, with a range of 9/15
 to 15/15. Due to my decision concerning problem 2 (see below), 3 of these
 points are "free" for many of you. 
</p>

<p>
 To my surprise, problem 1 caused consternation on your side, with all but
 one pair getting the notion of stuck state wrong. Consider this FSM
 specification: 
 <font size="-1"><pre><code>  (term (fsm "a" ("b") (("a" ("b") "b") ("a" ("b") "c")))) </code></pre></font>
 It is non-deterministic and the state labeled <code>"c"</code> is a
 <emph>sink</emph> of the graph but not a final state. Hence,  when this
 FSM is "applied" to the sequence that consists of one key
 (<code>"b"</code>), one path leads to a <code>(term REJECT)</code> state:  
 <center>
  <img align="center" src="Blog/nfa-reject.png" />
 </center>
 Please take a close look because this matters for the next problem set,
 too. 
</p>

<p>
 Problem 2 is a complete failure for most of you; I decided to ignore the
 problem for the grades. -- Apparently your undergraduate background does
 not enable you to carry out a straightforward proof by calculation. I
 decided to let you know what I think of your proof on a 3-point basis.
 Even if you have a perfect 3 (few of you), you should not think that you
 have found a proof that reviewers would accept. If you have less than 3
 points, you are in trouble. Study the proofs in the book for starters.

 other people; it accidentally runs on computers.  Good code is like good
 poetry. Everything fits: from the textual shape to the global
 organization. Bad code makes readers feel ill. Please work on your code
 design skills." Take me seriously; if you cannot write beautiful looking
 code in any language you encounter, you cannot compete.

 Here is one more example so that you can see how Redex/Racket code is
 formatted, documented, arranged:  
<font size="-1">
<code>
<pre>
  ;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ;; replace free variable occurrences with "free", bound ones with "bound"
  (define-metafunction PL 
    fv : e -&gt; e

  ;; invariant: (v ...) is the list of variables occurring in 'function' on
  ;;   the path from e_0 to e 
  (define-metafunction PL
    fv-aux : e (v ...) -&gt; e
    [(fv-aux v (v_1 ... v v_2 ...)) "bound"]
    [(fv-aux v (v_1 ...)) "free"]
    [(fv-aux (function v e) (v_1 ...))
     (function v (fv-aux e (v v_1 ...)))]
    [(fv-aux (e_f e_a) (v_1 ...))
     ((fv-aux e_f (v_1 ...)) (fv-aux e_a (v_1 ...)))])

  ;; possible escape to Racket for first two clauses: 
  ;; ,(if (member (term v) (term (v_1 ...))) "bound" "free")

  ;; tests, arranged bottom up because you want to check helpers first
  ;; term with the same variable free and bound 
  (define e0 (term ((function "x" "x") "x")))

  (test-equal (term (fv-aux "x" ("y" "x"))) "bound")
  (test-equal (term (fv-aux "x" ("z" "y"))) "free")
  (test-equal (term (fv-aux ,e0 ())) (term ((function "x" "bound") "free")))

  (test-equal (term (fv ,e0)) (term ((function "x" "bound") "free")))

</font>
 You should make the following, basic observations: (1) present most important function
 first, least important last ("top down") though you probably don't develop
 this way. (2) Write down one purpose statement for functions that belong
 together and an explicit invariant for each accumulator style function. (3) 
 Do not break lines in the middle of an expression just because the line
 would be more than 80 characters wide, see book/lecture. (4) let DrRacket
 indent for you. If you find yourself indenting on your own, you are making
 code look bad. Find a precedent and use it.

 The template step is 'crutch' for those of you who have never been

 There is no need to include templates in your solution; I will recognize

 not.

  The parser relies on two essential constructs for extracting content
  elements and attributes from XML element (representation): 
<font size="-1"><pre><code>  ;; retrieve all attributes from e with name in n ...
  ;; error messages are specified via msg
  (element-named-attributes msg:string n:id ...)

 (elements-named-content n:id ...)
 ;; XML-Element *-&gt;* [Listof XML-Element]

<font size="-1"><pre><code>    (module+ test

  The purpose of the project is summarized on the
  <a href="general.html">general syllabus page</a>. 
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Stage 1</nbsp></font> Pick a topic that you and your partner
  consider interesting (in the context of this course).  A list of
  suggested topics appears below.  It is acceptable if two pairs grab one
  and the same paper. If you would like to be more ambitious---recommended
  to PL students---look at the conferences or journals discussed in
  class. Read the abstracts and motivational sections.
</p><p>Get <font color="blue">approval by 09 October 2012</font> for your chosen
  topic. If your topic is from the list below, a simple email from one of
  you to me, ccing your partner suffices. Otherwise, submit a two-paragraph
  email: one summarizing the topic in your words, and a second one
  explaining why you wish to study this topic. 
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Stage 2</nbsp></font> A first reading of a technically
  complex paper should leave you with a shallow understanding and a desire
  to understand certain aspects in more depth. The best way to express this
  desire is to articulate your understanding and to phrase questions in
  this context. These questions tend to tell you which "tools"
  (mathematical techniques, implementation, measurements, etc) you will
  need to use to find answers.
</p><p>
 Write up a one-page memo in journal-paper style that (1) summarizes your
 current understanding of the paper, (2) states which aspects of the paper
 you would like to understand in depth, and (3) explains which tools (Redex
 and otherwise) you wish to use to model the paper's insights so that you
 gain the desired insight.  Researchers tend to think of this memo as a
 proposal.
</p><p>
 The <font color="blue">PDFed proposal memo is due 23 October 2012</font>.
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Stage 3</nbsp></font> Just do it! There is nothing like
  working on your chosen topic. Experience the feeling of understanding
  what the author really meant; what the author could have done. -- 
  Do not hesitate to consult with me if you're stuck! 
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Stage 4</nbsp></font> Report on your experience in a two-page
  "result" memo. The revised memo should consist of four parts: (1) the
  fixed-up summary from the "proposal" memo; (2) a
  revised and concrete set of questions that you tackled; (3) a description
  of the approach used to answer them; and (4) your answers (abstractly,
  because you have a limited amount of space). Do not write an essay on
  what you did in the past two weeks but imagine yourself writing a final
  report for a scientific grant that you obtained from a funding agency.
</p><p>
 To format the paper, use (1) an 11-point font, (2) 1.5in margins all
 around, (3) a header that specifies the paper title and the authors of the
 memo, (4) no section or subsection headings. If you wish to label a
 passage, use the so-called paragraph style, which boldfaces the initial
 phrase of a paragraph.
</p><p>The revised memo is due, in PDF form, on <font color="blue"> 20 November
  2012 before class</font>.  Email it as an attachment together with one
  Redex file (if needed). Both file names should use the last names of the
  partners, plus a suitable suffix (.pdf and .rkt).
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Stage 5</nbsp></font> Prepare a joint 40-minute whiteboard
 lecture that describes (1) the paper's problem, including the motivation,
 and background, (2) your questions, (3) the approach you used to answer
 these questions, and (4) the insight you gained. 
</p><p>
 Divide the talk between the two partners but each partner should be
 prepared to answer questions about the entire talk.
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Grading</nbsp></font> Your "deliverables" are: (1) the
  "proposal" memo, (2) the "report" memo, (3) the lecture; and (4) an
  appendix that documents your work (usually a Redex model).
</p><p>
 Your project grade consists of four different pieces: 
<ol><li>the initial formulation of a question concerning the topic; </li><li>the description of your answer or attempts, i.e., the 'revised memo'; </li><li>the in-class lecture; and</li><li>the Redex model in support of your answer.</li></ol>
 Both memos are judged at two levels: the content and its English
 (unit-level organization, style, grammar, typos). Similarly, the
 lecture is about both content and oral communication skills of
 technical matters. Finally, the Redex model must support the conclusion
 and must show that you have understood the basic modeling techniques. 
</p><p>A note on writing or "<em>less is more</em>." Concise language is
  superior to a lot of weasel words and paragraphs. The two limits (one and
  two pages, respectively) are <strong>upper limits</strong> not lower
  limits. -- Good technical writing focuses on the essence of a topic and
  avoids emotional verbs (e.g., "believe") or judgmental adjectives (e.g.,
  "wonderful"). -- Start a unit of writing with a 'thesis' and use the rest
  of the unit with support of the thesis.  -- Also, use active voice over
  passive voice. Connect sentences by starting sentences with idea-words
  near the ending of the preceding one; then introduce a new one.  Doing so
  is accepted American style of writing and technical writing. -- For a
  short elegant book on writing, see Strunk and White's "Elements of Style"
  (3rd edition).

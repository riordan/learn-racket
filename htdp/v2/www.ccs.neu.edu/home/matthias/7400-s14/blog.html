Congratulations to a job well done.</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><span style="color: red">The End</span></p></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Tue Apr 22 11:21:44 EDT 2014</span></p><p>You should have a lightly marked version of your final project code in your
inbox by now. The average grade is 92%, ranging from a low of 28/35 to a
high of 36/35. Yes, I award extra points on extremely rare occasions; this
pair actually earned two for an outstanding effort, according to the
criteria listed below.</p><p>We practiced all semester long deploying small pieces of
software in an appropriate manner: names of authors; contact emails;
purpose statements for the file (and or README files); purpose statements
for languages, functions, and relations; and a sufficient number of
tests.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">My professional code consists of 30% of unit tests and
for Redex model this number goes up to 50%.</span></span></span> I graded your project code
according to those basic aspects, spot-checking pieces here and there. The
weight of the project code is 13%, somewhat lighter then the weight of your
reports and your presentations, which I inspected closely.</p><p>If your project got you interested in the chosen topic and you would like
to use your model/code for anything in the future, feel free to contact me
over the summer for a detailed code walk.</p><p>The final presentation will take place tomorrow at 2pm in WVH 366. Ting
Chen and Cheng Li will present "Church: A language for generative models."
All are welcome; attendance is optional.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mon Mar 31 10:21:32 EDT 2014</span></p><p>I will attend ETAPS during the second week of April, so we cannot meet on
April 8. I have rescheduled the first pair for the last slot; the other two
pairs must contact me to schedule a separate presentation.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Sat Mar 29 19:10:36 EDT 2014</span></p><p>Assignment 8 is graded. The average grade is 89%.  The grades
range from 20/30 to 30/30. The score consists of two pieces:
a grade for passing my test suite and a grade for your code.</p><p>I went easy on those (many!) who failed to separate the problems
properly from provided files.</p><p>Note that in this day and age it is expected to treat Unicode files
properly.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Sun Mar 23 15:56:30 EDT 2014</span></p><p>A pair asks how to partition the presentations. The intention is that each
pair&rsquo;s presentation represents the paper and the pair&rsquo;s insights as a
coherent whole. This implies that the pair should split the presentation at
an appropriate point. I typically recommend that the first presenter starts
with the high-level summary of the paper from the proposal, the motivation
of studying this paper, and the questions that arose. The second presenter
can then deal with the investigative process and the pair&rsquo;s findings.</p><p>If the two investigators had different reasons for studying the paper, came
up with different questions, contributed differently to the process, do not
cover such details in a talk.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Wed Mar 19 10:19:10 EDT 2014</span></p><p>Please note the addition of <a href="presenting.html" data-pltdoc="x">Presentations</a>.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mon Mar 17 19:42:58 EDT 2014</span></p><p><div class="SIntrapara">Assignment 7, problem 2 is graded. The average grade is 65%.  The grades
range from 5/15 to 13/15. The score consists of three pieces:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">English</span> (6), which subsumes thesis statements, phrasing, word
choice, and spelling;</p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">ideas</span> (6), which applies to correctness of statements and
coverage (see below);</p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">organization</span> (3), which concerns both the organization of the
memo and the organization of individual paragraphs.</p></li></ul></div><div class="SIntrapara">For each category, a certain range of mistakes caused the subtraction of a
certain number of points. For example, two to five English problems fall
into the same rank, assuming equal severity.</div></p><p>Over the first eight weeks of the semester, we discussed language design in
terms of syntax, scope, informal semantics, the language of types and a
system of type checking rules, and a formal (operational) semantics. I
expected your memo to <span style="font-style: italic">cover</span> some of these terms per proposed
extension, to address them correctly, and to deal with at least one of them
fin some detail. Naturally I cannot expect you to spell out everything in a
one-page memo so I applied leniency where the memo indicated a basic
understanding of these issues.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Sat Mar 15 21:08:29 EDT 2014, <span style="color: red">amended Sat Mar 15 22:14:08 EDT 2014</span></span></p><p><div class="SIntrapara">Assignment 7, problem 1 is graded. The average grade is 85%.  The grade
reflects how your articulation of discrepancies explains discrepancies that
my <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7400-s14/Tests.tar.gz">test battery</a> found (if any). See "MF" in the returned README file for
details. Here are a three notes on the results:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>Most of you had faulty implementations. The model was accurate.</p></li><li><p>Only three pairs seemed to have seriously flawed models.</p></li><li><p>Some of you failed to read the blog concerning Dan&rsquo;s strange test
case. See below. In the future, make sure to read the blog.</p></li></ul></div><div class="SIntrapara">As explained in the first lecture and the lecture that prepared this
problem set, scientists have no choice but to improve their models when
they find discrepancies; engineers can usually change either the model or
the implementation.</div></p><p>On Tuesday, I will hand back the grades for problem 2 on paper.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Wed Mar 12 22:09:45 EDT 2014</span></p><p>Here are some of the sample programs from two weeks ago:

<a href="writing.html" data-pltdoc="x">Writing</a> with comments about your proposal memos. Please read
them. You will need to hand in your proposal memo with your research report
so that I can see how you reacted to my suggestions.</p><p>Keep in mind that you can consult with Ms. Biron more than once when you
are preparing your report.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mon Mar 10 16:36:01 EDT 2014</span></p><p>Due to a defense, I cannot hold office hours today.</p><p>For problem set 7, you may assume that (1) I will eliminate any
<span class="RktPn">(</span><span class="RktSym"><a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/redex/The_Redex_Reference.html#%28def._%28%28lib._redex%2Freduction-semantics..rkt%29._test-results%29%29" class="RktValLink" data-pltdoc="x">test-results</a></span><span class="RktPn">)</span> lines and (2) I will avoid running your tests. If
you find any other superficial differences due to the <span class="RktVal">'</span><span class="RktVal">(</span><span class="RktVal">"type\nerror!"</span><span class="RktVal">)</span> vs <span class="RktVal">"type error!"</span> discrepancy, you may let me know via
email.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Fri Mar  7 11:31:11 EST 2014</span></p><p>I found bugs in problem set 8&rsquo;s revised model and re-posted it. In case you
have downloaded the revised OO model, please re-visit.</p><p>In addition, I discovered that I relied on a feature of Redex that is
available in the "cutting edge" version only. I have now (Friday) annotated
the two places with commented replacements for those who are running a
regular DrRacket so that you don&rsquo;t have to download a new installation.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Wed Mar  5 11:53:05 EST 2014</span></p><p>Assignment 6 is graded. The average grade is 88%. The 30 points are
distributed over these categories: the formulation of the type
system; the modification of the <span class="RktSym">evaluate</span> function; and the proper
treatment of <span class="RktSym"><a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/redex/The_Redex_Reference.html#%28def._%28%28lib._redex%2Fgui..rkt%29._traces%29%29" class="RktValLink" data-pltdoc="x">traces</a></span> examples in an <span class="stt">sr</span> submodule.</p><p>My grading is quite lenient on the judgment rule formulation. As explained
in the book and the lecture, a judgment form specifies a structurally
recursive function with a context (sometimes a fixed-value "accumulator",
other times a truly accumulating parameter). I provided code for the
lecture example so you could study the idea in depth. When you design a
judgment, the design recipe covered in lectures 1 and 2 applies; it helps
and it makes the judgment(s) natural and readable. For in-depth hints, see
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7400-s14/ps8.html" data-pltdoc="x">Problem Set 8</a>; if you have questions, ask.</p><p>Please inspect the graded solution to make sure that I prepared your
model&rsquo;s <span class="RktSym">evaluate</span> function properly for running the comparison
checks for problem set 7. If you think I made a mistake, please send
email.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Sun Mar  2 20:14:02 EST 2014</span></p><p>Two pairs asked whether problem set 7 was due on Tuesday, March 4. No,
there are no class activities this week, not even problem sets are due.</p><p>Also, Dan Feltey points out that <span class="stt">7-script.rkt</span> contradicts the
specification <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7400-s14/ps6.html" data-pltdoc="x">Problem Set 6</a>. Instead of looking for <span class="RktVal">'</span><span class="RktVal">(</span><span class="RktVal">"type\nerror!"</span><span class="RktVal">)</span>, <span class="RktSym">main</span>&rsquo;s <span class="RktSym"><a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/if.html#%28form._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._if%29%29" class="RktStxLink" data-pltdoc="x">if</a></span> checks for <span class="RktVal">"type error!"</span>
instead. The reason is that I discovered a problem in the transition to
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7400-s14/ps7.html" data-pltdoc="x">Problem Set 7</a> and fixed it by modifying the model&#8212;<wbr></wbr>without changing
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7400-s14/ps6.html" data-pltdoc="x">Problem Set 6</a>. <span style="color: red">I will modify your solutions to <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7400-s14/ps6.html" data-pltdoc="x">Problem Set 6</a> so that
your model returns a plain string when it discovers a type error. Please
double-check when you get your graded and modified solution back.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Thu Feb 27 13:48:55 EST 2014</span></p><p>Associate Dean Agnes Chan has requested that I cancel all class activities
for next week, in particular, class on Tuesday. I will run a make-up class
in the last week of the semester at a time when I can secure a classroom.</p><p>Note the change to my office hour.</p><p>Finally, I have released the presentation schedule (see <a href="syllabus.html" data-pltdoc="x">Schedule</a>).</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Tue Feb 25 17:41:12 EST 2014</span></p><p>The project due date was misplaced.

as advertised. Sorry for this mistake.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mon Feb 24 18:35:27 EST 2014</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Mon Feb 24 16:55:47 EST 2014</span></p><p>You will keep your current partner through problem set 7, that is, you will
switch partnerships for problem sets 8, 9, and 10. If you already know who
you wish to partner with, you may let me know.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Sun Feb 23 19:23:39 EST 2014</span></p><p>Assignment 5 is graded. The average grade is 81%. The 12 points are
distributed over these categories: the proper formulation of the standard
reduction function, the proper formulation of the conjecture, proper
testing, and a few style points. The lower number of points reflects the
small number of changes needed to create this solution from the one for
problem set 3 (about four lines in my case). The goal was to give you time
for the proposal writing task.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Sun Feb 23 14:24:47 EST 2014</span></p><p>I have clarified <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7400-s14/ps6.html" data-pltdoc="x">Problem Set 6</a> in two places. Please look for strike-outs
and revisions.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Sat Feb 22 09:55:11 EST 2014</span></p><p>Please noticed that I modified the delivery specification for <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7400-s14/ps6.html" data-pltdoc="x">Problem Set 6</a>.</p><p>Here is some advice on the use of "we" in science writing. When you write a
descriptive piece or section of a paper, such as for your first writing
task, stay away from "we" completely. When you write a proposal, especially
for a funding agency such as NSF, consider using "the PI" or "the PIs" if
there is more than one primary investigator; you are welcome to employ this
style for your project proposal. Finally, when you write up the results of
an investigation, especially for publication in a conference or journal,
try to use (1) active voice, without turning software systems into little
humans, (2) "we" especially if you can use it in the sense of "you, the
reader, and I, the author" and preferably not in the sense of the "royal"
voice, and (3) passive voice including "to be" verb phrases.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Tue Feb 18 22:02:36 EST 2014</span></p><p>Here are the sample programs from tonight: <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7400-s14/L/6a.rkt">6a.rkt</a>,

<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/7400-s14/L/6d.rkt">6d.rkt</a>. For those of you who have not explored the
Racket&rsquo;s documentation yet, it contains a
<a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/redex/">tutorial on Redex</a> that is
highly recommended.</p><p>Also, I blanked on the names of the people who connected logic and type
theory initially. They were Curry and Howard, and the connection is called
the Curry-Howard isomorphism. Tim Griffin expanded this connection from
constructive (intuitionistic) logic to classical logic, using the lambda
calculus of control; Charles Baker (now NYU) and Ken Shan (now Indiana)
applied the same lambda calculus to conversations (i.e., computational
linguistics).</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Tue Feb 18 16:02:36 EST 2014</span></p><p>After some additional consideration, I have decided to teach a lecture
during spring break. For now I have reserved 366 in WVH for the usual
Tuesday slot. If we can agree to a more convenient three-hour slot, I
am willing to move the slot.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Sat Feb 15 20:49:43 EST 2014</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Tue Feb 11 22:03:40 EST 2014</span></p><p><div class="SIntrapara">In lecture, I skipped the following statement:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><span style="font-style: italic">Language L performs on-line type-checking.</span></p></blockquote></div><div class="SIntrapara">The authors probably mean that the IDE (interactive development
environment) statically checks the types as much as possible as a
programmer enters the text into an editor. If so, this statement really
exposes
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><blockquote class="SCentered"><p><span style="font-style: italic">a confusion between language L and the IDE.</span></p></blockquote></div><div class="SIntrapara">Many IDEs are constructed for many languages. Some of the latter have a
static type system, which the IDE can use to type check a program as it is
constructed. Others don&rsquo;t, in which case the IDE cannot check
anything. Conversely, a language L can be used in many different IDEs. Some
IDEs check types as the programmers completes phrases, others don&rsquo;t check
types at all. The key is not to conflate different elements in the tool
chain, because it limits your conception of ideas.</div></p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Tue Feb 11 10:30:09 EST 2014</span></p><p>See <a href="writing.html" data-pltdoc="x">Writing</a> for notes on how I graded your first memo and general

elements of style. Read it, read it again, and again. Late editions do not

look for "Bugs in Writing."</p><h4><a name="(part._.Notes_on_the_proposal_memos)"></a>Notes on the proposal memos</h4><p>I used mostly the same dimensions as for your descriptive memo to evaluate
your proposal memos. Instead of &rsquo;conclusions&rsquo; I assigned more points to the
&rsquo;paragraph organization&rsquo; and &rsquo;ideas/content&rsquo; dimensions.</p><p>In general, your proposals are reasonably well written. Congratulations .</p><p>One recurring big problem concerns [paragraph] organization. Time and again
memos bring ideas into the question/research paragraphs that are neither
prepared in the descriptive paragraph nor prepared. If you wish to discuss
aspect A of some paper in a paper, you need to introduce it first with a
neutral description. Later you can explain how A is unclear or why A
deserves additional investigation.</p><p><div class="SIntrapara">As for writing details, I continue to see
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ul><li><p>future tense in descriptive sentences</p><p>Your writings describe eternal truths. Stick to present tense until you
explain what you intend to do beyond the scope of the paper.</p></li><li><p>passive voice or overuse of "to be", even in opening sentences</p><p>Active voice drives an essay; passive voice and boring verbs turn off
readers. On occasion, passive voice facilitates the flow of
sentences. There is no need to bend over and look for active alternatives

someone specifies a specific layout, make sure your paper satisfies
it. Some conferences and funding agencies simply reject submissions that
violate such specifications.</p><h4><a name="(part._.Notes_on_memo_1__ps1_)"></a>Notes on memo 1 (ps1)</h4><p>I used the following dimensions to evaluate your descriptive memos:</p><ul><li><p>organization [2]: does the essay come with an overview paragraph that
states the overall thesis and spells out what the rest of the essay will
cover?</p></li><li><p>paragraphs [5]: are the paragraphs organized properly? A paragraph, like a
section or an entire essay, is a unit of writing. As such, it must come
with a thesis and focused, single-minded support for the thesis. This
support can come in various forms and shapes: logical arguments, general
explanations, and examples.</p><p>In AE, paragraphs are not dialectic, i.e., they do not cover both thesis,
antithesis, and synthesis. If an antithesis is to be presented, the
paragraph contains a clue word in one of its last sentences, e.g.,
"however", and a sentence that transitions to the next paragraph.</p></li><li><p>conclusions [2]: is the conclusion supported by the essay? or does it
inject new ideas? Don&rsquo;t write it in a high-school-ish way.</p></li><li><p>flow: do sentences and paragraphs connect to each other? I focused on
sentence-level flow and graded on the easy side. One trick is to use a
word/phrase from near the end of sentence n at the beginning of sentence
n+1 and to move on to a new idea here.</p></li><li><p>writing [6]: does the essay suffer from low-level problems here?</p><ul><li><p>spelling: Here are some typically bad typos to watch out for: "it&rsquo;s"
(contraction of it and is) vs "its" (possessive) "their" vs "there". Also
pay attention to capitalization.</p></li><li><p>choice of words: mismatch in numbers, "These hats is round."  the use
of non-descriptive/inappropriate nouns (wrong meaning), verbs (wrong
connotation in context of surrounding noun-phrases), adjectives (highly
subjective, colorful). It&rsquo;s also common to find "it" or "this" without a
clear reference.</p></li><li><p>sentences:  Scientific writing calls for complete sentences.</p></li><li><p>tense: Scientific papers mostly describe eternal truths. When they
do, they should use present tense, not future, not past. On occasion, a
paper describes an experience, in which case past tense is appropriate, or
future work (beyond the work explained in the paper), in which future
tense is acceptable.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>ideas/content [3]: is a claim obviously flawed (check the web)? is a
statement inconsistent with the rest of the claims? is terminology used in
an obviously mistaken manner?</p></li></ul><p>The evaluation gives little credit to the actual content. On many
occasions, these essays make blatantly wrong (and often repeated) claims,
abuse (widely used) terminology, or suffer from other problems that make a
programming language researcher cringe. Your memos usually barely suffered
from such mistakes. In addition, I did not disagree with any of the choices
nor the arguments in support of the choices. This last bullet is reserved
for mistaken ideas that a decent undergraduate education and
curiosity-based reading would have avoided.</p><h4><a name="(part._.A_proposal_memo)"></a>A proposal memo</h4><p>Below is a sample memo that is based on my personal experience as a PhD
student. It took me four months to understand the basics of this paper, and
then I spent nearly ten years working out solutions to the implied problems
that the paper poses. (There are a few left.)</p><blockquote><p><div class="SIntrapara"><blockquote class="SCentered"><p>Project Proposal</p></blockquote></div><div class="SIntrapara"><blockquote class="SCentered"><p>Call-by-name, Call-by-value, and the Lambda Calculus</p></blockquote></div><div class="SIntrapara"><blockquote class="SCentered"><p>Matthias Felleisen</p></blockquote></div></p><p>Gordon Plotkin&rsquo;s paper [1] studies the relationship between programming
languages and Church&rsquo;s lambda calculus. It specifically addresses the
scientific debate of how the call-by-value parameter-passing mechanism in
most programming languages relates to the beta rule of the
calculus. Concretely, the paper presents two variants of Landin&rsquo;s abstract
SECD machine for evaluating lambda terms&#8212;<wbr></wbr>one for evaluating according to
call-by-name and one for call-by-value&#8212;<wbr></wbr>and a variant of the lambda
calculus for each of them. It then proves one set of theorems for each
machine-calculus pairing: a Church-Rosser theorem, a Curry-Feys
Standardization theorem, a theorem relating the standard reduction relation
and the respective SECD, and a soundness theorem for the equational
calculation system with respect to the observational equivalence relation
generated by the SECD evaluator. The paper concludes with a section that
relates the two calculation systems to each other via Fisher&rsquo;s
continuation-passing style transformation.</p><p>At this point, we fail to understand three aspects of these results. First,
it remains unclear how the calculations in the by-name and by-value
calculus differ for sample programs. Second, we are wondering how the
equational calculation system relate to the standard reduction
relation. Third, we wish to study Plotkin&rsquo;s proof that the evaluation
function based on the standard reduction function is the same as the one
defined by Landin&rsquo;s SECD abstract machine.</p><p>For the first two questions, we intend to build a call-by-name and a
call-by-value calculus, respectively, with Redex. Then we will create a
series of increasingly complex sample programs and study their reduction
graphs, i.e., the graphs generated by the general reduction relation of the
calculus. We expect that we can develop a strategy for identifying the
standard reduction path(s) in these graphs. Finally, for the third
question, we intend to break up Plotkin&rsquo;s proof into smaller pieces,
focusing on one abstract register from the SECD machine at a time. By
transforming the machine one step at a time, the proof should become
self-explanatory. We will initially focus on the proof for the
call-by-value system; it should become obvious how to port this method to
the call-by-name system.</p><p>1. Gordon Plotkin. Call-by-name, Call-by-value, and the Lambda

 burning question on your mind as you start your college career: 

   <blockquote>How am I going to get an A in this course?</blockquote><p>We have some news for you: you are in college now, and in college, it
  really is about learning something and not (just) getting a grade. As a
  matter of fact, if you are taking a course and the A comes easy, you are
  either cheating yourself or you are allowing the instructor to cheat
  you.</p><p>Here is the positive take-away from this section: College is your last
  chance to learn how to learn by yourself, without pressure from parents,
  teachers, or peers. You want to learn that, because the quality of your
  life depends on it. Your life. Nothing more, nothing less. </p><p>Naturally, we understand that you want some feedback, both in terms of
 specific corrections and in terms of a grade. You want feedback so that
 you can improve your learning process. And we will give you that
 feedback. It is our end of the bargain. Your end is to demonstrate that
 you actually use the methods and tools for learning that work best in our
 experiemce. After all, you don't want to waste your time, and we don't
 want to waste ours either.</p><p>So, if you wish to earn a grade in this course, you must print the
 Course Contract (see tab on the left), sign and date it, and turn it
 during your first lab session (CSU 212).  Your signature acknowledges that
 you have read and understood the contract and its implications. As long as
 you will live up to its spirit, we will stand by you during this
 semester. 
 </p><font color="red" style="italic">People: </font> In a large freshman course such
as CSU 211 you typically encounter three kinds of people, listed in
increasing order of relevance to you: 

<p><strong>Instructors:</strong><blockquote>
  Profs. Matthias Felleisen, Olin Shivers</blockquote></p><p><strong>Teaching Assistants:</strong><blockquote>Theo Skotiniotis, Ryan Culpepper, Dale Vaillancourt, Carl Eastlund, Christos Dimoulas</blockquote>

 TAs teach labs, supervise the grading of homework sets, hold office hours,
 and occasionally substitute in lectures.  In general, they are apprentice
 teachers and are here to learn how to run a course.

</p><p><strong>Tutors:</strong><blockquote>Michael Morgano, Charles Costa, Erin McLaughlin, John Mendelewski, Michael Reed, Matt Horan, Carol Lee, Jonathan Pelc</blockquote>

 Tutors hold office hours and group meetings in colleges and labs, grade
 homeworks and provide feedback about the class's progress.  In general,
 they are undergraduate and graduate students who know that to learn
 something really well, you need to teach it.
</p><font color="red" style="italic">Class: </font> Class consists of lectures and
lab meetings (CSU 212).

 <p><strong>Lectures:</strong> The course has two lecture sections: 
 <blockquote><table border="0" cellspacing="5"><tr><th>Section</th><th>Location</th><th>Instructor</th></tr><tr><td>MWTh 09:15am</td><td>Shillman 135</td><td>Felleisen</td></tr><tr><td>MWTh 10:30am</td><td>WVG 110</td><td>Shivers</td></tr></table></blockquote>

 You must sign up for one section and make an effort to attend this section
 on a regular basis. If you (need to) miss a lecture, you're welcome to
 attend the corresponding lecture in some other section.
 </p><p><strong>Labs:</strong> The course also has lab sections, aka CS U 212.
  The labs start on Tuesday, September 12.  You signed up for a lab section
  during registration; if you need to change your choice, you must go to
  the registrar and change it there.</p><p> You will attend your chosen lab section on a weekly basis. The purpose
     of labs is to give you some hands-on experience with the actual tools,
     and to explain some of the principles from lecture with hands-on
     examples.
 </p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Computing Environment: </font> We will use
 DrScheme v352, a programming environment for the Scheme programming
 language, some dialects of Java, Algol 60, OCAML, and a few others. For
 CSU 211, we will stick to the <a href="http://www.htdp.org">HtDP</a>
 teaching languages plus teachpacks.  DrScheme is installed on the CCS
 computers. It is also freely available on the Web (see tabs on the left of
 this page) in case you wish install it on your own computer. 
 </p><p>DrScheme runs on most popular platforms (Windows 2000/XP, Mac OS X,
 Linux, and other *nixes). Programs written in DrScheme have the same
 behavior on all platforms.  You therefore do not need to worry what kind
 of machine you use when you run DrScheme programs. 
</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Problem Sets: </font> The purpose of the
 problem sets is to prepare you for the exam.</p><p>
 There will be weekly problem sets. Some problems are drawn from HtDP, the
 textbook; others are constructed for this instance of CSU 211.  We will
 grade some but not all problems from each set (picked randomly
 <em>after</em> the due date).
 </p><p>We will drop the homework grade with the worst impact on your final
 grade from consideration for the final grade.  Thus, if you choose to skip
 an assignment set or if you just don't get it one week, nothing is
 lost. The story is different for the second or third or ... time. 
 </p><p> You are free to collaborate at will with others on the problem
 sets. If you do so, you must acknowledge all collaborators on your cover
 page. Failure to do so will result in a report to the ethics officer of
 the university and reductions of your grade.
</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Amendment: </font><font color="blue">
 As of Friday the 13th,
 October 2006 we will consider <em>all</em> collaborations outside of your
 assigned partnership as cheating and will report it to the administration.
</font></p><p><font color="red" style="italic">The News: </font> 
 
 The technology that computer scientists develop has a profound impact on
 people's lives. Bad software kills; bad software destroys large technology
 projects; and bad software is responsible for all kinds of mishaps with
 huge financial consequences. Of course, good software, which is still a
 rarity, prolongs people's lives; makes large technology projects happen;
 and is a key factor in the tremendous economic expansion that this country
 has experienced since the mid 1990s (with a short hiatus in 2001/02). 
</p><p>
 As a result computers (in all shapes), software (good and bad), and the
 people (technical and business-oriented) behind them are constantly in the
 news. So that you understand the "professional atmosphere" of your chosen
 field, we expect you to turn in at least one piece from a news outlet:
 newspapers; magazines; on-line and off-line. A clipping must contain the
 source and the date of appearance so that we can locate the original. In
 addition, you must add a three to five line paragraph, summarizing the
 article. 
</p><p>These articles are worth 5% of your weekly homework grade. The top-five
  summaries and articles will get a 100% score for the weekly homework,
  regardless of how they do on the homework problems. Naturally, the
  graders will still provide feedback on your problems, because you need
  this to prepare for the exams. 
</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Pair Programming: </font> You
 <font color="red">must</font> work on your problem sets (2 - 11) in pairs.
 Your partner will be in your lab, and your lab TA will assign you a
 partner. Every few weeks, you will get a new partner.
 </p><p>Pair programming means that you and your partner work on the problem
 sets jointly. You read them together and you work on the solutions
 together. One of the lab's purposes is to teach you how to work in pairs
 effectively; indeed, pairs are provably more effective than individuals in
 programming. The rough idea is this: One of you plays <em>pilot</em>, the
 other <em>co-pilot--looks</em>. The pilot works on the keyboard and
 explains aloud what is going on; it is the co-pilot's responsibility to
 question everything. After a problem is solved to the satisfaction of
 both, you <font color="red">must</font> switch roles. 
 </p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Exams and Quizzes: </font> We will have two
  hour evening exams to assess your progress: 
 <ul><li>16 October 2006</li><li>20 November 2006</li></ul>
 Both exams will take place from 6:30-9:30 in 200 Richards Hall (see
 <a href="http://www.campusmap.neu.edu/"> Campus Map</a> for details).
 </p><p>The exams will test material similar to that assigned in weekly
 homeworks. You will take the exams by yourself. Collaboration is not
 tolerated.  If you can solve every homework problem on your own, the exams
 will be easy.  If not, you will have a difficult time. </p><p>We will have <em>the daily quiz</em>. It is our one concession to your
 "high school thinking". Consider it a crutch for your self-discipline.
 Each week we will select <em>at most one</em> of these quizzes on a random
 basis for grading; the rest will get thrown away.
 </p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Grades: </font> You will get a gpa for your
 homework, for your quizzes, and for your exams. You <em>must</em> have
 both a passing homework gpa and a passing gpa to pass the course. For the
 final grade, we will assign a weight of 25% to the homework grade, a
 weight of 60% to the two exams, and a weight of 10% to the quizzes.  The
 remaining 5% are up to the instructors' whim (TBE).

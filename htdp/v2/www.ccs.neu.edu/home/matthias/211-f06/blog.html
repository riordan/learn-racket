Over the past couple of weeks, some of your email has taken up to 12 hours
to arrive in our accounts. I had our systems people track this down and
they found the following: 
<blockquote>
<p>
We've noticed that one of their mail servers that delivers outgoing mail
 (they have several) had managed to be listed on one of the Real Time
 Blacklists as a spammer: ...
</p>

<p>
This led that server to be treated as a spammer. Their server dealt poorly
 with the protection we have in place from spam blasts  (namely that we
 only allow one connection at a time from that spammer to go through after
 being throttled) which potentially could have led to problems with getting
 mail to us. 
</p>

<p>
It looks like they have since dealt with their listing. Just in case this
 happens again, we've whitelisted all of the NEU.edu domain. This was
 something we were initially hesitant to do because we had reason to
 believe that compromised machines in places like ResNet and other NUnet
 segments could be used to dump spam on us. Given the recent concerns,
 we're going to bite the bullet and just whitelist the entire University's
 network.

<p>
 If you are a computer science major, I urge you to use your CCS.NEU.EDU
 mail account to communicate with faculty. The College's mail system isn't
 without faults but, in my five-year experience, far more reliable than the
 University's.

Dan Gover sent us a wonderful question yesterday, a page long but easily
 boiled down to
<blockquote>
 How does one arrange a large program such as the UFO game? 
</blockquote>
 We discussed an answer to this question in class, and even blogged the
 code, but here is another, general take. 
</p>

<p>
 When you design a program that consists of more than a single function
 (or a couple of them), you proceed in three stages: 
<ol>
<li>You plan the program in a <em>top-down</em> fashion. You design your
  representation for the world: things that stay the same, things that
  change. Based on that and the interface to the Operating System in your
  beloved programming language (world.ss), you also create a wish list of
  functions. That's your plan.
</li>

<li>Then you program, i.e., you design your functions according to the
  recipe, using the data definition and the wish list. Do it well. 
</li>

<li>
 Finally, you must arrange your program so that others can easily figure
 out what it is about and how to find things (constants, functions, tests,
 data, etc) in it. Here is how I go about it: 

<pre>
<code>
#| War of the Worlds 
   Matthias Felleisen
   30 October 2006
   Language: Intermediate
   Teachpack: world.ss

   This program implements a "War of the Worlds" ..
   ... a brief (one paragraph) purpose statement .. 
|#

;; --------------------------------------------
;; Data Definitions 
;; -- (global relevance, local go where needed)
;; 
;; World is (make-world UFO AUP Charges Shots)
;; ... 

... structure definitions ... 

;; data examples are good here: 

(define WORLD0 ...)

;; --------------------------------------------
;; World Constants 
(define WIDTH 800)

;; --------------------------------------------
;; The Main Function 

;; Number -&gt; true
;; .. fire tick events at frame-rate fr ..
(define (main fr)
  (and (big-bang WIDTH HEIGHT (/ 1 fr) WORLD0)
       (on-tick-event world-next)
       (on-key-event world-change)
       (on-mouse-event world-stop)))

;; --------------------------------------------
;; WORLD FUNCTIONS: 
;; .. all functions that process worlds ..

;; In general: 
;; .. functions grouped by data collection ..

;; Choose names systematically. 

;; LAST: library functions 
;; .. (those with many masters) ..

;; --------------------------------------------
;; TESTS
... group all tests together, bottom up,
... separated via symbols 

;; --------------------------------------------
;; RUN, PROGRAM, RUN
(main 28)
</code>
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
Over the next week or two, you will get to know a fourth stage: editing a
program. This involves using existing abstractions and inventing
additional abstractions to improve your program. 
</p>

<p>
 When you organize your thoughts, think of your program as a book. It has
 chapters and sections. Organizing it well means others can comprehend
 it. Use "Special | Insert Large Letters" and "Program Contour" for an
 overview. The "(define ...)" drop-down menu is also helpful to navigate
 books; it's like an index.

in. The framework removes most of the work in
deciding how to structure a game leaving only the
most basic routines to be coded by the user: logic
and drawing. Its pretty fresh and maybe not that
useful yet but I just wanted to get it out there in
case anyone has any comments.

<p>1. You can prove (and you will learn to do so) that this is not enough to
cover all possible cases. It's minimal measure of testing. (Good enough for
211, not in general.)</p>

<p>2. For 211, I recommend testing the auxiliaries, too.</p>

<p>3. For a software engineer (with a few years of experience), I expect him
to make a judgement call about testing small functions like this or testing
them in context only. It's something for which you need experience. Quite a
bit.</p>

<p>P.S. You should <em>never</em> test whether two <em>images</em> collided
  but whether their representations did (are close enough). Images are
  nothing; the representation is everything.

 You may wish to study some of <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/211exams/">the exams from past
 CSU211 courses</a>. In general, it is important to keep in mind that the
 exam is not about getting correct code or repeating knowledge; that's why
 it is an open-book and open-notes exam.
</p>

<p>The key is that you know how to follow the design recipe so that you can
 solve problems even if you have never before seen anything like it. A
 specific example concerns lists. A lot of students copy definitions for
 list-processing programs and tinker with them, until running them in
 DrScheme seems to solve the problem at hand. While this may get you enough
 credit for a B- (and a paying job when programmers are in demand), it
 won't get you an A and it won't make you a good programmer. 

 We want to train programmers well. Hence, be prepared to find data
 definitions that do not look like any of those you have seen in class. If
 you can follow the design recipe, you can solve these problems. If you
 don't understand the process, you won't solve them.

During Olin's and my absence, the second section of the class covered a bit
more ground than the first, especially covering Cartesian points/structs:
<ul>
<li>
 develop a function that measures the "Manhattan distance" to the
 origin. In Manhattan, you can only walk square blocks. So a house at 3rd
 street and 10th avenue is 13 blocks away from the origin of Manhattan (and
 that is?). 
</li>

<li>
 develop a function that measures the Euclidean distance to the origin. See
 HtDP and instances of <code>posn</code>. Given a point <code>(x,y)</code>,
 its Euclidean distance to the origin is measured as the square root of the
 sum of the squares of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. (This follows
 from Pythagoras's law concerning rectangular triangles. Why?) Look up
 square in HelpDesk.

<li>
 develop a function that measures the distance between two Cartesian
 points. For good practice, develop two versions: one that uses just
 primitive operations and another one that uses the "distance to origin"
 from the previous bullet.

<blockquote>
<p>The demonstrated effectiveness of UAVs in combat motivates us to 
consider the development of a much smaller class of UAVs, so called 
micro air vehicles (MAVs), that would be capable of autonomous operation 
in confined airspace such as urban canyons or forest edges.  As 
engineers, we naturally look to precedent for the development of new 
capabilities and we find an almost endless number of potential analogs 
for MAVs in living bats, birds, and insects.  Among the more obvious 
technology challenges, we find that our training as engineers, 
emphasizing construction of systems from the interface of distinct 
functional components, presents a barrier to developing an understanding 
of biological flight appropriate to the development of new design 
concepts for MAVs.  This lack of understanding cuts both ways: 
biologists are trained in scientific inquiry rather than engineering 
design and, therefore, often do not appreciate engineering approaches.  
So we first have to answer the question "How do we facilitate a 
productive dialogue with biologists?" before we can broach the "What can 
we learn from biology?" question.</p>

<p>In this talk, I will attempt to present a vision, somewhat personal, on 
how engineers and biologists can collaborate on leveraging an 
understanding of bats, birds, and insects to develop new classes of MAVs 
with unprecedented autonomous aerial agility.  I will highlight several 
interdisciplinary research projects which I believe are demonstrating 
successful approaches to biology-inspired engineering.  Finally, I will 
suggest several areas of research that will particularly benefit from an 
interdisciplinary approach.</p>

 re: Project 12, test fest. The test fest will use the following
 interpretation of the test specifications: (1) the Actions specify how the
 test harness simulates the player and (2) the Results specify how the
 proxy turn should responds to the action. You may note that this statement
 <em>is</em> the original problem statement. (For whatever reason,
 someone's email got me to write the red correction (now struck out) and
 to make an incoherent change to my own test harness.)

 Jose and I discussed the test fest and came to the conclusion that we will
 grade project 12 as planned but without any extra credits for the test
 fest. Due to the high failure rate, my tests discovered all possible flaws
 in the running test harnesses.

 Instead, we will re-run the test fest on <font color="red">Friday (April

 based on that run. You have my test cases; you will have any corrections
 if you convince me of mistakes in the test case design; and you have the
 test cases of those pairs who worked out the project.

 teams supply incorrect XML (is it really a problem to fix bugs from

 The grade for project 12 is based on your code base as of Friday 4/08,
 9:30am. For the competition, you may polish your code until Friday 4/15. 
 The final code walks will also cover your code base as of Friday 4/15. 
</p>

<p>
 The competition will proceed in four rounds. Each team may participate
 with one AI player. For the first two rounds, we will run an Ingenious
 game using random collections of your players. The top two survivors 
 move to the winner bracket and the remaining survivors move to the loser
 bracket. If the server eliminates a player during the first two rounds,
 the player is eliminated from the entire competition.  In the third round,
 the losers play against each other. In the fourth and final round, the
 winners play for first place.
</p>

<p>
 The competition is a chance for you to collect <em>extra points</em>.  All
 teams whose players survive the first game get 10 extra points. Eliminated
 players do got receive any points.  All teams whose players survive the
 second game (loser or winner bracket) get another 20 extra points. The
 winner of the competition gets 20 extra points for a total of 50 points
 for the competition.

<h3>On Recursion, Especially Generative Recursion</h3>

<p>
 The code walks on Friday (3/18) suggested that people have difficulties
 with selecting data traversal strategies. As HtDP (aka PDP I and
 Fundamentals I) tell you, most coding is structural recursion and for
 <em>linear</em> (enumerable) structures, this is almost always expressed
 with functions such as <code>for-each</code> or <code>map</code> or
 manually defined looping functions, all of which correspond to one of the
 looping constructs in industrial-strength languages such as Java.
</p>

<p>
 In the context of the Ingenious game, we know that the board consists of
 some fixed number of cells. One possibility is to say that drawing the
 board means drawing all cells: 
<font size="-1"><pre><code>;; draw the cells of the board into the given canvas 
(define/public (draw-board board-canvas)
   ;; Cell -&gt; Void 
   (define (draw-one-cell cell)
     (define coordinates (send cell polar-coordinates))
     ... compute geometric locations from coordinates ...
     ... which is a simple geometric translation ... 
     ... draw cell ...)
   (for-each draw-one-cell (send board view-as-list-of-cells)))
</code></pre></font>
</p>

<p>
 An alternative is to use the pedestrian mechanisms of numeric loops. 
 For example, we know that an Ingenious board for a certain number of
 players has a certain number of cells limited polar dimensions.
 Specifically given n players, its  maximal diameter is n+3 and we know
 precisely how many cells there are in each layer: 1, 6, 11, etc. So we
 could write nested silly for loops: 

<font size="-1"><pre><code>;; draw the cells of the board into the given canvas 
(define/public (draw-board board-canvas)
   ;; Cell -&gt; Void 
   (define (draw-one-cell cell)
     (define coordinates (send cell polar-coordinates))
     ... compute geometric locations from coordinates ...
     ... which is a simple geometric translation ... 
     ... draw cell ...)
   (for ((layer (in-range (+ number-of-players 3))))
     (for ((index (in-range (+ (* layer 5) 1))))
       (draw-one-cell (send board lookup layer index)))))
</code></pre></font>
</p>

<p>
 A means of last resort is to use <em>generative recursion</em>, i.e., to
 view the data structure as a graph and to conduct a graph traversal. Here
 is how to write down this kind of traversal properly: 
<font size="-1"><pre><code>;; draw the cells of the board into the given canvas 
(define/public (draw-board board-canvas)
   ;; Cell -&gt; Void 
   (define (draw-one-cell cell)
     (define coordinates (send cell polar-coordinates))
     ... compute geometric locations from coordinates ...
     ... which is a simple geometric translation ... 
     ... draw cell ...)
  ;; 
  ;; BoardCoordinate [Setof BoardCoordinate] -&gt; Void
  ;; generative recursion: graph traversal of board 
  ;; draw the cell at cell-coordinate and then recur on all of its neighbors 
  ;; accumulator: cells-visited records which cells have been reached from cell0
  (define (traversal cell-coordinate cells-visited)
    (cond
      [(member cell-coordinate cells-visited) (void)]
      [else (draw-one-cell (send board lookup cell-coordinate))
            (for ((neighbor (send board <font color="red">neighboring-six-cells</font> cell-coordinate)))
               (traversal neighbor (add-to-set cells-visited cell-coordinate)))]))
  ;; 
  (define cell0 (send board lookup (new coordinate% [x 0][y 0])))
  ;; --- IN  --- 
  (traversal cell0 (empty-set)))
</code></pre></font>
 I am using "last resort" here because (1) it takes more skill to design
 this properly and (2) it takes more skill to read this kind of code than
 structural recursion. Worse, when you know exactly how many neighbors you
 have and when the entire graph is extremely regular, chances are that you
 should be able to recognize some structure. 
</p>

<p>
 Which brings me to the essential point of the message. Good program
 designers are people who learn to see 'geometric structure' in data
 representations and translate it into code. In "HtDP" we try to show you
 the connection between the two, that is, the second part. The ideal is
 when the code organization represents the organization of the data; in
 OO languages that properly implement tail-calls, doing so is easy and
 highly encouraged. Due to a lack of time, we can't show you how to
 view one and the same  data representation from different angles and how
 to learn to see 'different geometries' in a data structure. In the context
 of the Ingenious game, it easy to see that (1) the board is a graph and
 that the game uses it as a graph and yet (2) the board has additional
 structure. That is why I have represented the board as a series of layers
 <em>and simultaneously</em> as a graph. That way my scoring function can
 traverse it as a graph (as it should) and the drawing function can
 traverse it as a linear structure (as it should). 
</p>

<p>
 Finally, here are two specific remarks concerning the code walks on
 Friday. The first code was an attempt to implement a graph traversal and
 to exploit a bit of the extra structure of the graph. The second code was
 an attempt to implement only a graph traversal using generative recursion,
 but it failed to spell out how it was doing so either in a comment or via
 code (or both). That's why a reader (and someone who may have to take
 over) would have a difficult time to understand what is going on. Remember
 your design recipes, and remember that silly languages force you to use a
 looping construct to traverse linear structures.

 Some of you asked whether you really aren't allowed to modify any of the
 code in your code base and the answer is YES. Furthermore, the ideal
 solution does not rebuild any of the elements in the code base but uses
 them to build the human player interface. The not-ideal-but-acceptable
 solution rebuilds some of the elements from the code base. 
</p>

<p>
 One thing you need to know is that this constraint isn't as stringent as
 it looks. You may read the source code, and you may "link" to any "public"
 identifier. In reality, this mode of work is common for large "special
 purpose" code bases with extensibility APIs. For some APIs---especially 
 language-centric ones---you don't have these freedoms; in those cases, you
 really need to work with what you have in the documentation and nothing else.

 During today's code walk, Jose asked the question whether a strategy can
 precompute all possible tile placements for a single turn, and I said that
 he was right without finishing my explanation. Since the optimal tile
 placement is a function of many pieces of information -- including 
 the state of the board, the score of the other players, and the player's 
 current hand -- it is impossible to compute it once and for all at the
 beginning of the turn. Why? Because the player finds out whether he
 receives another tile and which one he receives <em>after</em> 
 placing a tile. Put differently, while it is possible to implement some 
 strategies against Chris's API, you can't compute all of them.

office hours to Wednesday 12:00-14:00. If this doesn't work for you and you
are planning to come, let me know and we can make an appointment.
</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong>
Regarding project 5: I suggest you all take some time to read the chapter 
on Proxies in your book. Many of your implementations leaked private data 
in an unsafe manner--providing a getter to a reference of your private 
data will certainly cause problems. This programming assignment was not
particularly difficult...spend more time designing than coding!
</p>

<p>
There were too many problems with use cases this week. First, provide a
description or diagram of how the game works in reality. With a little bit 
of thinking/tweaking it will lead to a fairly reasonable idea of how the 
software should work. Second, tease out the interface for the *proper*
entity. The task asked for a use case and interface of the Player not 
the Admin/Server/Game, yet many of you provided a Player function such as
<code>void register(PlayerInfo ...)</code>, 
<code>getGameInfo()</code>, and 
<code>getBoardState()</code>
etc. Look at your interactions diagram--which way are the arrows pointing?
Arrows pointing into the Player are good indicators of required
functions. Arrows pointing away from the Player are (mostly) irrelevant in
determining the interface for the Player. Realize that a diagram with
unlabeled arrows to blobs on a page is useless.

 As the semester progresses, I will assign additional weight to the design
 tasks. Don't take this lightly. If you can't live as a designer, your
 plain programming job may migrate to China, India, or Romania.

 a player must always place a tile as long as one side of the tile touches

 For a player's first placement of a tile, the "touching" hexagon is a

succeeded or in case of an error with detailed error message as to which
tests failed. 

Once you pass the bots, you commit it to the main tree, at which point
another bot takes and compiles and runs even more thorough tests on all

<p>Someone sent the following question via email: 
<blockquote>
 ... you want us to specify the use-case for the "model" part of an

 getting the state of the board.  Now, the last sentence in Friday's blog

 of the stoftware make to the board representation.  Does that mean you
 want us to flesh out how the board interacts with the view, the proxy,
 other model components, etc?
</blockquote>
 Here is my response: 
<blockquote>
 You have a software story (see step 1) and you have some basic idea on
 what data the remaining software may require w/o revealing it all. What
 interactions with the board are required to implement a turn?  
</blockquote>
 To get you on the right track, let me add that the idea of "asking for the
 board's state" either violates everything we discussed concerning safety
 and security or is equivalent to saying "asking the board to hand over
 itself". After all the board 'object' (instance of some class, instance of
 a structure, stateful module) represents the state of the board. So once
 again, what kind of questions does the player ponder as he puts down a
 tile? How can these questions be turned over into "purpose statements" and
 "contracts" (plus names) for a functions/methods in a
 module/class/package? (Don't forget PDP I!).

 My expectations for task 2 is that you write one-paragraph extensions of

 on your imagination. 
</p>

<p>
 For task 3, your task is highly technical. As in the Squadron Scramble
 example, the use case 3 should enumerate what capabilities the
 <em>model</em> of the board should have. Ask yourself, if I buy into any
 of the software stories from task 2, what kind of "calls" should the rest

 Your memos suffered from several serious flaws and wouldn't give you much
 credit with a professional manager. Here are the most critical point to
 watch for when you rewrite your draft: 
<ol>
<li>
 <p>
 A <em>technical</em> memo must stick to points for which you have solid
 evidence. Evidence may come in many forms and shapes. For example, you can
 point to the language specification to establish a claim about the
 linguistic capabilities of your choice of language. Or you can name the
 library/framework that is going to be used and explain why it meets the
 desired specification. It is not acceptable to simply state that language
 L meets criteria XYZ with weak or no support or to take refuge to
 imaginary arguments about the programmers in the company. (Fire them if
 they can't use the most productive tools.)
 </p>

 <p>
 When I told you in class that you should use a language that you know, I
 did not release you from making a case for your language. After all if you
 find out that you know the language well but it doesn't support XYZ well,
 you will have to use some other language. Put differently, your personal
 experience or your personal preference is unimportant for your manager and
 his manger for whom he will rewrite your memo.
 </p>
</li>

<li>
 A memo is specific, to the point, and devoid of technically looking
 material, e.g., tables and figures. It is common that your manger will
 make small changes and pass on the memo to someone 'higher up'. The less
 work it is for him, the better for you. 
</li>

<li>
 Finally many of you violated some small points, using the wrong format;
 writing from a first-person perspective; filling space with "weasel" words
 and content-free filler phrases; and/or employing bullet
 lists/subheadings/etc. Don't do that.  Write fluent, easily readable
 English that is to the point.

 You will have a chance to correct all these mistakes with the third

<h3>Squadron Scramble</h3>

<p>
 Next week I will demonstrate how to develop stories and use cases via an
 extensive case study, the Squadron Scramble game.  Squadron Scramble is a
 card game from the World War II era. <em>Restoration Hardware</em>
 resurrected the game a couple of years ago, which is where I bought it for
 my sons. Please read the description below; we will use it in class to
 develop a story and some use cases.
</p>

<p>
 The objective of the game is to conduct an "air war" with the Axis and
 Allies fighters and bombers depicted on the playing card. Naturally, each
 "war" consists of "battles." A player earns points in each battle until some
 player has won the "war." 
</p>

<p><strong>The Cards</strong> The deck includes airplane types from all
 major Axis and Allies nations, e.g., 

<blockquote>
<table align="center">
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="bottom">
 <img alt="[a17]" src="Blog/Northrop&#32;A-17a.jpg" width="50" />
</td>
<td align="center" valign="bottom">
 <img alt="[do26]" src="Blog/Dornier&#32;Do&#32;26.jpg" width="50" />
</td>
<td align="center" valign="bottom">
 <img alt="[p47]" src="Blog/Mitsubishi&#32;96.jpg" width="50" />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Northrop A-17a (US)</td>
<td align="center">Do 26 (German)</td>
<td align="center">Mitsubishi 96 (Japan)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
 There are three cards for each airplane type in the deck. Also the
 airplanes are classified as either <em>fighters</em> or <em>bombers</em>.
</p>

<p>
 In addition to airplane cards, the deck contains one "Victory" card and
 six "Keep'em Flying" cards.  All seven of them may be used as wild cards. 
</p>

<p><strong>Conducting a Battle</strong> At the beginning of a
 <em>battle</em>, the dealer shuffles the deck and then hands each player
 seven cards. The rest of the deck is placed faced-down. The top-most card
 is turned over (face-up), visible to all.
</p>

<p>
 A randomly chosen player starts the battle. The remaining players get
 turns in a clock-wise fashion.
</p>

<p>
 When it is a player's turn, the player must take exactly one card from the
 face-down deck or at least one card from the face-up stack. At the end of
 the turn, the player must return one card, face-up to the top of the
 face-up deck, unless the player has put <em>all</em> cards on his hand on
 the table and has thus finished the battle.
</p>

<p>
 A squadron consists of three cards for the same airplane type or two cards
 for the same type plus one wild card or of one aircraft card plus two wild
 cards. For any <em>complete</em> squadron on his hand, a player may put it
 down (face-up).  As the player discards squadrons, he may use a complete
 Axis [Allies] squadron of fighters to shoot down exactly one Allies [Axis]
 squadron of bombers that some other player has already put on the
 table. The "shot-down" squadron becomes his, and the cards can't change
 owner again during the course of a battle.

<p>
 When a player has put down all cards in his possession, the battle is
 over. A battle is also over if the deck is empty and there are fewer than
 three cards left on the stack.
</p>

<p><strong>Scoring a Battle, ...</strong> When a battle has ended, each player
 receives fifteen (15) points for a fighter squadron on the table and
 thirty (30) points for a bomber squadron, including those shot down from
 other players. Every player must then subtract five points (5) per fighter
 card and ten (10) points per bomber card on his hand. The wild cards on a
 player's hand cause no penalty.
</p>

<p><strong>..., Winning a War</strong> The war is over when at least one
 player has collected at least 250 points at the end of some battle. The
 player with the most points is the winner.

<p><strong>Implement the Game</strong></p> I am your client and I would
  like a software version of Squadron Scramble. Can you produce one?



<p><strong>Getting Started with the Story</strong></p> All client-provided
 stories are ambiguous, incomplete, and even inconsistent. Your first task
 is to find these flaws so that you can ask the client questions about the
 story. You and the client will then jointly complete the story.

 Welcome.

<p>
 It is time to get started, and this means for you that you must start
 working on your projects and assignments. This course is a lot of work 
 and aims to teach you a lot by doing. If you stay on top of your work, it
 is manageable; otherwise the work will overwhelm you. Don't hesitate to
 ask for help when you get the feeling of being lost. 
</p>

<p>
 Good luck.

 You must keep a course journal (diary) in a note book. Keep a separate
 notebook for your lecture notes.
</p><font color="red" style="italic">Purpose: </font><p>
 The general purpose of a journal is to document your work and your
 collaborations.  If anything goes wrong, it can help you reconstruct the
 past and convince others of your position.
</p><p>
 For this course, the journal is to help you manage your partnership. You
 must document every meeting: its purpose, duration, accomplishments,
 failures, agreements. 
</p><font color="red" style="italic">First Page: </font><p>
 The first page of your journal is dedicated to information about your
 partner. You should enter the following information on this page: name,
 address, (cell) phone, email address and optionally a screen name if you
 wish to use an IM tool. (Do not use IM to conduct pair programming
 sessions.) Put nothing else on this page.
</p><font color="red" style="italic">Projects: </font><p>
 Create a new cover page for each project. Enter on this page the title of
 the project, your process plan, and time estimate (in minutes) for each
 step of the process. Create a conclusion page for each project. Record on
 the page how many meetings you conducted and how much time (in minutes)
 you actually spent on the project. Note: you won't get credit for accurate
 time estimates. For your own sake, you should be as honest as you can with
 these estimates, so that you learn to estimate how much time real project
 work will consume.
</p><font color="red" style="italic">Meetings: </font><p>
 Create a new page for each meeting. You must schedule (when/where) each
 meeting at the end of the previous meeting; start with scheduling when you
 agree to partner. Ideally, you should block six regular meeting hours per
 week.
</p><p>The first three lines of each meeting page must record the following: 
<ol><li>when and where you met (entered during previous meeting)</li><li>when and where you will meet next</li><li>when you stopped the meeting</li></ol>
 At the end of a day of a meeting, write down what you accomplished during
 the meeting and any other thoughts you find worthwhile. 
</p><p>
If your partner doesn't show up for the meeting, make a note. Also record
what actions you undertook to reach your partner. If you sent email, print
a copy and glue it into your journal.

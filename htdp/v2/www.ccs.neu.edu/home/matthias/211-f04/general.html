		If you wish to earn a grade in this course, you must print this Web page and the one on Communications, 
		see tabs on the left, 
		staple the physical pages, sign and date the first page at the top-right, 
             and initial the segments on communication, pair programming, and exams. 
             Your signature acknowledges that you have read and understood <em>all</em> of this 
            page and its special segments.  The signed contract is due in class on the day after the first lab. 
	</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">People: </font><p><strong>Instructors:</strong> 
			<a href="../index.html">Matthias Felleisen</a>, 
 			<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/clements">John Clements</a>
		</p><p><strong>Teaching Assistants:</strong> 
		<blockquote>Carl Eastlund, Sam Tobin-Hochstadt, Jeff Palm, Stevie Strickland, Rebecca Frankel</blockquote>

			TAs teach labs, supervise the grading of homework sets, hold office hours, 
			and occasionally substitute in lectures. 
			In general, they are apprentice teachers and are here to learn how to run a course.
		</p><p><strong>Tutors:</strong> 
		<blockquote>Laura Huber, Kevin Roche, Mike Burns, Joe Dooley, Brian Laferriere</blockquote>
			Tutors hold office hours and group meetings in colleges and labs, 
			grade homeworks and provide feedback about the class's progress. 
			In general, they are undergraduate and graduate students who 
			know that to learn something really well, you need to teach it. 			
		</p></p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Class: </font> Class consists of lectures and lab meetings.

		<p><strong>Lectures:</strong> The course has two lecture sections: 
		<blockquote><table border="0" cellspacing="5"><tr><th>Section</th><th>Location</th><th>Instructor</th></tr><tr><td>MWTh 09:15am</td><td>Shillman 335</td><td>Felleisen</td></tr><tr><td>MWTh 04:30pm</td><td>WVH 108</td><td>Clements</td></tr></table></blockquote>
		You must sign up for one section and make an effort to attend this section 
		on a regular basis. If you (need to) miss a lecture, you're welcome to attend 
          the corresponding lecture in some other section. 
		</p>

	<p><strong>Labs:</strong> The course also has lab sections. The labs start on Monday, September 15.
		You must sign up for a lab section during your first lecture, and you must
		attend this lab section on a weekly basis. The purpose of labs is to 
		give you some hands-on experience with the actual tools, and to 
		explain some of the principles from lecture with hands-on examples. 
		</p>		

	</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Computing Environment: </font>
		 You will do your assignments in DrScheme v208, a programming environment for Scheme. 
		 DrScheme is installed on the CCS computers. DrScheme  is  also freely available on the Web 
		  (see tabs on the left). You may install it on your  computer at home and work there.
	</p><p>DrScheme runs on most popular platforms (Windows 2000/XP, Mac OS X, Linux). Programs 
		  written in DrScheme have the same behavior on all platforms.  You therefore do not 
		  need to worry what kind of machine you use when you run DrScheme. 
	</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Assignments: </font>	

		There will be 11 problem sets. The problems are 
		drawn from the book and are supplemented with additional problems.  We will grade some 
		but not all problems from each set (picked randomly <em>after</em> the due date).
     </p><p>
		We will drop the worst homework grade from consideration for the final grade. 
		You may therefore choose to skip one homework set; we'll just assign a zero (0) for this homework. 	
	</p><p><strong>Due Date:</strong> 
		Electronic submissions of your homeworks are (usually) due on Monday at 4:00pm. 
		Most are submitted electronically. You should give yourself 30 minutes to submit
		the homework because in our experience, the server is overloaded at due time. 
	</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Pair Programming: </font>
	  	You <font color="red">must</font> work on your problem sets (2 - 11) in pairs. 
		Your partner will be in your lab, and your lab TA will help you find someone. 
	</p><p>
		Pair programming means that you and your partner study the problem sets individually and 
	  	possibly even sketch out solutions. Then you meet and jointly develop solutions to each problem.
		One of you--the pilot, and the other one--the co-pilot--looks over the pilot's 
		shoulders. When something isn't clear, it is the co-pilot's responsibility to question the approach. 
		You <font color="red">must</font>  switch roles during such a problem solving session. 
		We will practice pair programming in lab. 
	  </p><p>
		You are free to collaborate at will with others on the problem sets. If you do so, you must
		acknowledge all collaborators on your cover page. Failure to do so may result in reductions 
		of your homework grade. 
	</p><p><font color="red">Everyone must be able to solve every homework problem on the due date.</font></p><p><font color="blue">Warning: You must be able to solve every homework problem on your own.</font></p><p><font color="orange">Are you sure you have read the warning?</font></p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Exams and Quizzes: </font> 
		We will have two hour evening exams to assess your progress:
		<ul><li>14 October 2004</li><li>18 November 2004</li></ul>
		Both exams will take place from 6:30-9:30 in Richards 200
 		(see <a href="http://www.campusmap.neu.edu/"> the campus map</a>).
	</p><p>
		The exams will test material similar to that assigned in weekly homeworks. You will take the
		exams by yourself. Collaboration is not tolerated.  If you solve every
		homework problem on your own, the exams will be easy. If not, you will probably have a difficult time 
		with the exams. </p><p>
		To provide some discipline, each lab session with start with a quiz on the preceding 
          homework (or lecture material). If you don't answer the questions on the quiz correctly, you will not get 
          a grade for that week's homework set and you are warned that you're not on track. 
	</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Grades: </font> 
		You will get a grade for your homework (factored by the quiz performance)  and 
		a grade for your exams. <em>Both</em>
 		must be passing grades; otherwise you cannot pass the course. For the final grade, we
 		will assign a weight of 35% to the homework grade and a weight of 60% to the two exams.
 		The remaining 5% are up to the instructors' whim.

<p><font color="red">Good Bye.</font></p>

<p>
  We have finished grading the final projects. The results were mostly
  positive and showed that you learned something this semester. Keep it up! 
  If you are in desperate need of your final grade, contact John Clements
  (clements at ccs dot neu dot edu) or see him at this desk. Otherwise just
  wait for the goodies in the mail. If you would like to get your marked-up
  final project back, see Stevie. 
</p>

<p>
  This is the last message on the blog. So let me take the opportunity
  again to say that I enjoyed this semester very much. Good luck with your
  future work on and off campus, and <font color="red">don't forget the
  design recipe.</font>
</p>

<p>-- Matthias Felleisen</p>

</div></blockquote></div><div><hr /><p><b>Monday, December 6th, 2004</b></p><blockquote><div>

<center><font color="red">How We Will Grade Your Final Project</font></center>

<p>The grading process for the final project will heavily rely on the
  design recipe and the programming guidelines ("one task, one function"
  and friends). To make this concrete, I have compiled a list of specific
  check points: 
<ol>
<li>Does the electronic version of your program compile, test, and run? We
  will allocate 20 points to this part alone.</li>
<li>Does your program come with correct data definitions?</li>
<li>Does your program come with correct contracts and reasonable purpose
  statements for all functions?</li>
<li>Does your program come with a test suite for every function? (You may
  use small lambda functions w/o testing them.)</li>
<li>Is each function organized according to the proper template? (You do
  not need to show templates, and you won't get better grades for showing
  templates.) 
</li>
<li>Does your program use functions for each task? (Or is it one big lump
  of code?)</li>
<li>Did you abstract common patterns or did you turn in the first
  draft?</li>
</ol>
You all know what correct means for data definition and contract. Even
though both borrow some English words, they are rigorously defined notions
and leave little space for error. For the formulation of data definitions
and contracts, you may use <code>Listof[...]</code> but you must not
use <code>list</code> by itself; this just doesn't exist. 
</p>

<p>Warning: You will get no points for creative extensions of the game or
  extra features. While such creativity is necessary to sell products, it
  is necessary for you to demonstrate that you have absorbed the
  principles of design so that your business can survive the first
  generation product. 
</p>

</div></blockquote></div><div><hr /><p><b>Tuesday, November 30th, 2004</b></p><blockquote><div>

<center><font color="red">Getting Your Design Checked</font></center>

<p>On Thursday, December 2, 2004, you must see either your head TA (from
  your lab) or John Clements to get your design approved. Your design
  should consists of a DrScheme print-out that contains: 
<ol>
<li>your names</li>
<li>your instructor's name/your head TA's name</li>
<li>your project's title</li>
<li>data definitions for all the data your program must process</li>
<li>contracts and purpose statements for major functions, arranged in
  sections according to the class of the major argument</li>
<li>optional but highly recommended: examples turned into tests</li>
</ol>
 You need to obtain the signature on these sheets, retain them, and turn
 them in as an appendix with your final project. Not appending the signed
 design to your hand-in will result in a 30-point penalty. 
</p>

<p>The schedule for Thursday is as follows: 

<blockquote>
<table><tr><th width="160">Time</th><th width="200">Head TA</th></tr>
<tr><td width="160">08:00-09:40</td><td width="200">Jeff Palm</td></tr>

<center><font color="red">Help for Final Project</font></center>

<p>
 Important: You will not receive any help from an instructor, a TA, or a
 tutor if you ignore the design recipe. When you aske for help, show them
 your data definitions, your "wish list" of functions with contracts and
 purpose statements, your examples, etc. Then show them where you are
 stuck.  --- Just in case there are any doubts, we will use the design
 recipe to allocate points and for being able to run it. "But it worked
 when I ran it" will give you 0 points.

<p>
 For this project, we do not allow collaboration between teams. You may
 only work with your partner and nobody else. We will use tools that
 discover non-obvious plagiarism to test for violations of this policy.

<p>For your orientation, I have posted <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/211-f04/Blog/homework-week4.html">the solution and grading
  rubric</a> for the problem set of week 4. Study it carefully so you
  understand how we follow the design recipe; what we expect; and how we
  grade. The exam will look just like the homeworks, and we will grade it
  just like a homewor.

<p>
You may turn in problem set 4 in two ways: 
<ol>

<li>as a stapled set of pages in front of <font color="red">West Village H
    330</font> (aka WVH 330); or 
</li> 

<li>via the homework server.</li>
</ol>
In either case, the submission is due before  <font color="red">Monday (04
  October) 6:00pm</font>. Starting next week all submissions will go
  through the server. 
</p>

<p>
If you use the server, you may earn up to six points of extra credit (on
top of 36), if we can run your program and the reasonable test cases produce
<code>true</code>. 
</p>

<p>The server will be open for business as of Sunday October 3, noon.</p>

<p><b>Quiz:</b> We, the instructors, have decided to ignore the quiz from
  last Tuesday. Recall that this implies a "no exceptions" stand from here
  on out to the end of the semester. Study! 
</p>

<p><b>Office Hours:</b> Sam Tobin-Hochstadt has moved his office hours from
  1-3pm to 2-4pm. Laura Huber has also moved her office hours by 20

 the program <code>go</code> (for green-is-out)</a>. While it is important
 to understand the program and even how it works (step through some small

<p>For your orientation, here is the solution and grading rubric for the quiz of
week 3:</p>

<p>
<b>Problem:</b> Someone introduced a new class of structures as follows: 
<code>
<pre>
  (define-struct author (first last yob yod))
  (define-struct book (title author publisher year))

  ;; An Author is: 
  ;;  (make-author String String PosIntegerNumber FON)

  ;; A Book is: 
  ;;  (make-book String Author String PosIntegerNumber)

  ;; A FON is one of: 
  ;;  -- false 
  ;;  -- PosIntegerNumber
</pre>
</code>  
Make up an example for the class of Books.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<code>
<pre>
(make-book 
 "HtDP" (make-author "M" "F" 1873 false) "Press" 2001)
</pre>
</code>

<p><b>Grading:</b>
If the students get three out of five right, give a 1, otherwise 0:
<ul>
 <li>use make-book and make-author </li>
 <li>use false or positive integer in make-author position 4</li>
 <li>place an instance of author in slot 2 of make-book</li>
 <li>strings in positions 1 and 3 of make-book </li>
 <li>a positive integer in position 4</li>
</ul>

<p><font color="red">Study Groups</font> We encourage you to form study
 groups. The ideal study group consists of several pair programming
 partnerships. These groups should meet briefly each week. You may discuss
 problems with the homework assignments in these study groups though don't
 exchange solutions. Ask each other the relevant questions for each step in the
 design recipe. Also you should use these study groups to prepare for the
 upcoming exam, but <a href="general.html">keep in mind</a> that you must be
 able to solve all homework problems on your own.</p>

<p><ul><li>6.3.1: This problem asks you to draw boxes. You may do these as
drawings on paper or as "ascii art" in the DrScheme definitions window. 
Either is acceptable.</li>
<li>Additional Problem 1: The final step is to "modify tick."  Since the
data definition now tracks seconds, the tick function should advance the
clock one second at a time, rather than one minute at a time.</li>
<li>Additional Problem 2: you may assume that the bird flies horizontally at
the same speed the rock falls.  That is, the bird flies at 3 pixels per
tick.</li></ul></p></div></blockquote></div><div><hr /><p><b>Friday, September 24th, 2004</b></p><blockquote><div>

</p>

<p>
As for problem set 3, there will be five labeled boxes near the door of WVH
330, one per lab.  The labels will specify the time of the labs. You must
place your homework in the box for the lab that you attend.

<p>You must turn in your homework with your partner.  We will not accept homeworks
submitted by one person, unless an instructor has explicitly agreed to it. You must
work on your homework in pairs.  Please see the contract that you signed for more
details.</p>
<p>You must go to the same lab as your partner. If this is impossible, you must
arrange a swap of partners.</p>
<p>Each week's lab includes a quiz. A zero on this quiz means a zero for the week's
homework. (Again, this is covered in the contract that you signed.)  This means that
if you don't go to the lab, you won't get credit for the homework.</p></div></blockquote></div><div><hr /><p><b>Friday, September 24th, 2004</b></p><blockquote><div><p>Homework 1 is graded and available for pickup.  The assignments are outside WVH

<p>From the book store:

<pre>Professor Clements,

      I apologize for our error with your book order.
I have ordered 140 additional copies of "How to Design
Programs" by Felleisen.  The books should be available
in the store by Monday, September 13th.  I have asked
the publisher to try to ship the books today, and ship
overnight to arrive Friday.  If they do not ship until
tomorrow, we will then receive them Monday.

      Again, I am very sorry for any inconvenience to
you and your students.  If you have any questions,
please email or call me at X2286.

Thank you,
Gretchen Suarez
</pre></p>

<p>That is, by Monday you should be able to buy them in the bookstore, if you
so desire. </p>

  From: 	  mflatt@cs.utah.edu
  Subject: [plt-edu] One more down time this evening
  Date: 	September 8, 2004 10:53:30 AM EDT
  To: 	  plt-edu@list.cs.brown.edu

The network-hardware problems near www.plt-scheme.org 
and www.htdp.org have been fixed.

There will be one more down time this evening, however, 
due to a scheduled power outage: 5:00 PM to 10:00 PM MDT 
Wednesday, September 8 (this evening).

No further outages are expected.

If you need to download software during the outage, 
you should still be able to reach
  http://download.plt-scheme.org
which is a different machine/network/building/timezone.

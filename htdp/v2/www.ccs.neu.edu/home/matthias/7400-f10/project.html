  The purpose of the project is summarized on the
  <a href="general.html">general syllabus page</a>. 
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Stage 1</nbsp></font> Pick a paper that you want to
  understand via a Redex model. A list of papers will appear on this web
  page by the fourth  week and you are welcome to choose one of them.  
</p><p>
  If you would like to be more ambitious, look at the conferences or
  journals discussed in class. Read the abstracts and motivational
  sections. If it interests you, figure out what part of the paper you want
  to elaborate (semantics, types, implementation, etc). Students in PL/SE
  should probably focus on recent results; others may wish to look at old
  results.
</p><p>Get <font color="blue">approval by 8 October 2010</font> for your chosen
  paper. We will ensure that you have mutually disjoint topics.
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Stage 2</nbsp></font> Formulate a problem statement as a
  one-page tex'ed or word'ed memo. This is the very first step a researcher
  must take, and a good amount of time is often spent on working out what
  the problem is. Here you should think of the problem statement as a goal
  statement, namely, which part of the chosen paper you wish to turn into a
  Redex model and what you hope to learn. The <font color="blue">problem
  statement is due 2 November 2010</font>. 
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Stage 3</nbsp></font> Just do it! There is nothing like
  working on your chosen topic. Experience the feeling of understanding
  what the author really meant; what the author could have done. -- 
  Do not hesitate to consult with the instructor if you're stuck! 
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Stage 4</nbsp></font> Report on your experience in a revised
  version of the memo; don't use more than two pages. That is, elaborate
  your problem statement because you will have insights that improve
  it. Then add a couple of paragraphs on what you learned. The revised memo
  is due on <font color="blue"> 19 November 2010.</font> A print out of the
  Redex model should be an appendix to the <strike>model</strike> memo. 
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Stage 5</nbsp></font> Prepare a joint 30 minute presentation
  that describes the problem, its motivation, its background, the Redex
  model, and your insight. Divide the talk between the two partners but
  each partner should be prepared to answer questions about the entire
  talk.
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Deliverables</nbsp></font> Your final deliverables are: (1) the
presentation; (2) two-page memo; and (3) an appendix that documents your project
work.</p><font color="purple"><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Grading</nbsp></font> 
 Your project grade consists of four different pieces: 
<ol><li>the initial formulation of a question concerning the paper; </li><li>the description of your answer or attempts, i.e., the 'revised memo'; </li><li>the in-class presentation; and</li><li>the Redex model in support of your answer.</li></ol>
 Both memos are judged at two levels: the content and its English
 presentation (typos, grammar, unit-level organization). Similarly, the
 presentation is about both content and oral communication skills of
 technical matters. Finally, the Redex model must support the conclusion
 and must show that you have understood the basic modeling techniques. 
</p><p>A note on writing: "less is more". Or, concise language is superior to a
  lot of weasel words and paragraphs. The two limits (one and two pages,
  respectively) are <strong>upper limits</strong> not lower limits and not
  required writing. -- Good technical writing focuses on the essence of a
  topic and avoids emotional words (e.g., "believe") or judgmental adjectives
  (e.g., "wonderful"). Also, use the active voice over passive voice, and
  connect sentences. Start a unit of writing with a 'thesis' and use the
  rest of the unit with support of the thesis. This is both accepted
  American style of writing and technical writing. For a short elegant book
  on writing, see Strunk and White's "Elements of Style" (3rd edition).

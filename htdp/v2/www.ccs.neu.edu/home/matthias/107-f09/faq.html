   Go get a CCIS account for using the Windows, Mac, and Unix computers
   in the College. These accounts are <em>distinct</em> from those that
   Northeastern University assigns to you. To obtain the CCIS account, go
   to the <em>systems department</em> on the third floor of WVH, read
   the instructions posted next to the door, an fill out a form.

 In short: learn to speak about technical issues in front of
 small and large groups of peers. Here is a slightly longer
 explanation, including a justification. Design is about
 thinking. When we think on our own without feedback for a long
 time, it is easy to make mistakes early, to overlook them for a
 long time, and to trust in all the decisions we have made from
 the very beginning. We therefore consider it imperative that
 you learn to articulate your thoughts about programs, that you
 are able to explain why you decided to use one strategy and not
 the other, that you can justify your actions on the spot. Only
 when people articulate their thoughts and decision making
 process can others help them recognize and correct mistakes. 
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%">What can I read to prepare myself?</td><td width="50%">
 The course uses two text books. The first one is 
 <a href="http://www.htdp.org">How to Design Programs</a>, 
 a book on design in a functional language context. Both text books are
 (or will be) available at the book store. The HtDP text is also
 on-line and includes numerous exercises. If you have time,
 start solving the exercises. 

 The second one is <cite>How to Design Classes.</cite> It is available at
 the Northeastern Reproduction as a bound manuscript; you may need to ask
 for the text for CS U 213. 
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%">Why can't I see the solutions?</td><td width="50%">
 The on-line version of HtDP contains links to the solutions of the
 exercises. These solutions are password protected so that teachers at
 other institutions can reuse them. Also, many of the exercises are
 assigned as "warm up" exercises for the weekly homework sets. In order to
 participate in the weekly help sessions you must show attempts to solve
 those exercises. Copying the solutions from the web would defeat the
 point.

    course?</td><td width="50%">
 Northeastern has created this course to equip all MS students with at
 least the minimal program design knowledge that the graduates of our BS
 program have. Based on experiences with past generations of MS students
 and based on recent feedback from co-op companies, we expect that this new
 course is closer to what MS students bring along and that it prepares MS
 students better for an internship than the old PPL course.

 Exceptionally experienced students may discuss their personal situation
 with the instructor <em>after the first lecture.</em></p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="25%"> What is pair programming?</td><td width="50%">
Pair programming means that you and your partner work on the problem
 sets jointly. You read them together and you work on the solutions
 together. One of the lab's purposes is to teach you how to work in pairs
 effectively; indeed, pairs are provably more effective than individuals in
 programming. The rough idea is this: One of you plays <em>pilot</em>, the
 other <em>co-pilot--looks</em>. The pilot works on the keyboard and
 explains aloud what is going on; it is the co-pilot's responsibility to
 question everything. After a problem is solved to the satisfaction of
 both, you must switch roles.

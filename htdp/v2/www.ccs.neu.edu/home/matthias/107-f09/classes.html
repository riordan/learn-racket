 Creating a class is like creating a function. While 
<pre><small>  (lambda (NAME ...) EXPRESSION)</small></pre>
 creates a function, a definition of the shape 
<pre><small>  (define FUNC-NAME (lambda (NAME ...) EXPRESSION))</small></pre>
 introduces a name for a function. For the latter, you mostly use the
 shorthand 
<pre><small>  (define (FUNC-NAME NAME ...) EXPRESSION)</small></pre>
 but this really is just an abbreviation. The rest of this section
introduces the syntax for creating classes. For naming classes, use
<small>define</small>. 
</p><p>
 In the following explanations, whenever you see <small>X ...</small> read
 "a possibly empty sequence of Xs". 
</p><p>A <small>CLASS</small> is one of: 
 <ul><li><pre><small>(class CLS 
   (init-field VRL ...)
   ELT ...)
   </small></pre></li><li><pre><small>(class* CLS (INAME ...)
   (init-field VRL ...)
   ELT ...)</small></pre></li></ul>
 where <small>CLS</small> and <small>INAME</small> are the names of classes
 and interfaces, respectively. By convention all class names end in
 <small>%</small> and all interface names end in <small>&lt;%&gt;</small>. 
</p><p>A <small>VRL</small> is one of: 
 <ul><li><small>NAME</small></li><li><small>(NAME EXPRESSION)</small></li></ul>
 where <small>NAME</small> is a variable name. 
</p><p>A <small>FLD</small> is <small>(NAME EXPRESSION)</small> where <small>NAME</small> is
  the name of an <small>init-field</small> in the instantiated class. 
</p><p>An <small>ELT</small> is one of: 
 <ul><li><small>(super-new FLD ...)</small></li><li><small>(define/public (NAME NAME ...) EXPRESSION)</small></li><li><small>(define/private (NAME NAME ...) EXPRESSION)</small></li><li><small>(field VRL ...)</small></li></ul>
 where <small>NAME</small> is a variable name. 
</p><h4>Interface Syntax</h4><p>A <small>INTERFACE</small> is: 
 <pre><small>(interface (INAME ...) NAME)</small></pre>
 where <small>INAME</small> is the name of an interface and <small>NAME</small>
 is the name of a method. 
</p><h4>Expression Syntax</h4><p>
 Classes are used to create objects, which are first-class values just
 like functions. In contrast to functions, objects can be called in many
 different ways, one per <small>public</small> method in its class. This two
 new forms of syntax are specified in this section. 
</p><p>An <small>EXPRESSION</small> is one of: 
 <ul><li>... all the things you know</li><li><small>(new CLS FLD ...)</small></li><li><small>(send EXPRESSION NAME EXPRESSION ...)</small></li><li><small>(is-a? EXPRESSION CLS)</small></li></ul>
 where <small>CLS</small> is a class name (actually, an expression that
 evaluates to a class) and <small>NAME</small> is the name of a public
 method.

 Some comments on this code, starting with the row dubbed "data
 definitions". Just like the teaching languages, the Module language does
 not impose any restrictions on what values a variable may represent. To
 design programs it is therefore necessary to explain to future readers
 how classes should be used. Here we see that the creation of an object
 from <small>posn%</small> must supply two numbers, one for the
 <small>x</small> field and one for the <small>y</small> field. The
 interpretation of the fields is supplied as a comment, too. 
</p><p>
 The creation of object examples (also called "instances" of the class)
 employs a by-label protocol, meaning the values for the fields of an
 object are specified via a label not via a position in some argument
 list. While this protocol is more verbose than by-position, it is
 definitely easier to understand--especially when some fields come with 
 default values and aren't even mentioned in the argument list. 
</p><p>
 In a class-based world of design, you use <strong>methods</strong> not
 functions to express functionality. It is understood that methods always
 consume one <strong>implicit argument</strong>, dubbed this, and however
 many additional explicit arguments as needed. For these additional
 arguments, you must specify a contract--just as before in BSL/ISL.  The
 purpose statement is always formulated in terms of <strong>this</strong>
 object, its fields, and the remaining arguments. A method accesses the
 field values of the implicit <strong>this</strong> argument via the names
 of the fields. See the red <small>x</small> and <small>y</small>. For the
 additional arguments, the method must use method calls (also known as
 "send a message") to obtain knowledge about the internals. Here the
 <small>posn+</small> method uses the <small>get-x</small> and
 <small>get-y</small> methods to obtain the coordinates. Last but not least,
 notice the blue occurrences of <small>x</small> and <small>y</small>. These
 are NOT variables, but the externally visible labels for the initial
 fields of <small>posn%</small> objects. 
</p><p>
 When it comes to testing, class-based programming occasionally imposes an
 additional overhead. You might expect that 
<pre><small>(check-expect (send ex-c posn+ O) ex-c)</small></pre>
 might work as before, but this is not the case. It is impossible (for you)
 to compare objects in this straightforward manner. You must instead
 use methods to extract basic values (numbers, booleans, strings, symbols,
 images, or instances of structs) and then compare those. 
</p><p>
 Last not but least, the above code doesn't run in Module per se. You also
 need to require the unit testing library explicitly: 
<pre><small>(require test-engine/scheme-tests)</small></pre>
 and then call 
<pre><small>(test)</small></pre>
 at the end of the file explicitly. To see which parts of your module the
 tests (don't) cover, open the Language Dialog, look at the Details and
 click the check box for "syntactic test suite coverage". 
</p><hr /><h4>Design I</h4><p>
 The basic purpose of a class system is to combine structures and functions
 on structures into one coherent whole. It is thus orthogonal to the design
 of programs per se. When you develop a data representation, you still need
 to understand whether 
<ul><li>it represents basic forms of data</li><li>or simple compounds, like structures</li><li>or itemizations of different sub-classes of data</li><li>or mutually referential/self-referential itemizations</li></ul>
 and so on. Let's quickly check how to deal with itemizations of
 subclasses of data, first the simple case and then the self-referential
 case. 
</p><p>
 Consider a data representation for geometric shapes, which should include
 circles and squares and possibly other forms of shapes. In addition, say
 we wish to compute the area of these shapes and render them into
 pre-existing scenes. A representation appropriate for programming with
 classes looks like this: 
<pre><small>
;; all geometric shapes support these methods in all contexts 
(define shape&lt;%&gt; 
  (interface ()
    area ;; -&gt; Number
    ;; compute the area of this shape

    render ;; Scene -&gt; Scene
    ;; add this shape to the given scene 
    ))

;; a circle 
(define circle%
  (class* object% (shape&lt;%&gt;)
    (init-field x  ; Number, x pixels of center from left
                y  ; Number, y pixels of center from top
		r  ; Number, radius
		c) ; ColorString 

    (define/public (area) (* pi r r))

    (define/public (render s) (place-image IMG x y s))
    (field [IMG (circle r "solid" c)])

    (super-new)))

;; a square parallel to sides of canvas 
(define square%
  (class* object% (shape&lt;%&gt;)
    (init-field x  ; Number, x pixels of upper-left from left
                y  ; Number, y pixels of upper-left from top
		l  ; Number, length of one side 
		c) ; ColorString 

    (define/public (area) (* l l))

    (define/public (render s) (place-image IMG x y s))
    (field [IMG (rectangle l l "solid" c)])
    
    (super-new)))

(define s1 (new circle% [x 10][y 20][r 40][c "red"]))
(define s2 (new square% [x 10][y 20][l 40][c "red"]))

(check-within (send s1 area) (* pi 1600) .1)
(check-expect (send s2 area) 1600)
</small></pre>
 Note the purpose statements of the interfaces and classes as well as the
 methods in the interfaces. The method definitions per se do not need such
 comments anymore. Because of the "implements" specification of the
 <small>class*</small> form, a reader knows that the contract and purpose
 statement are found in the interface. Do run this code in drscheme and
 determine for yourself what the tests cover. 
</p><p>
 One kind of data you may wish to represent composites of geometric
 shape. This could take many forms, so let's focus here on one where one
 geometric shape is superimposed graphically onto another. In an HtDP-style
 data definition, you would write something akin to this: 
<blockquote>
A shape is one of: 
<ul><li>a circle</li><li>a square</li><li>a combination of two shapes, with one specified as the "top" and the
  other one to be the "bottom" shape. 
</li></ul></blockquote>
 To implement it you would translate this description of information into 
 structure definitions with a data definition that expresses the above with
 your chosen constructors. The self-reference from above would become a
 self-reference in the semi-formal English definition. 
</p><p>
 In the world of classes and interfaces, some of this relationship is
 expressed via the "implements" clause and with some more English: 
<pre><small>
;; two overlapping shapes
(define overlay%
  (class* object% (shape&lt;%&gt;)
    (init-field top  ; shape&lt;%&gt;, the shape on top 
                bot) ; shape&lt;%&gt;, the shape underneath
    
    (define/public (render s)
      (send top render (send bot render s)))
    
    (define/public (area)
      (+ (send top area) (send bot area)))
    
    (super-new)))
</small></pre>
 As you can see, we no longer have a data definition in one place, but the
 comments on the <code>init-field</code>s tells readers that the data
 representation is self-referential. Not surprisingly, the two methods in
 this class are recursive in that they use the <code>render</code> and
 <code>area</code> methods, respectively, for their fields to compute the
 appropriate results. We know that the values in the fields (are expected
 to) have such methods from the data definition comments on the fields. 
</p><p>
 You may also have noticed that the addition of <code>overlay%</code> did
 not require any modification of either the data representation per se or
 the methods in other classes. This property of a class-based
 object-oriented organization of programs--design as before with a
 structural strategy--is dubbed "extensibility" and is often touted as an
 advantage of object-oriented programming. It is the result of two
 properties of class-based languages: 
<ol><li>
 the packaging of data definitions with structures and functions as
 classes; and</li><li>
 the encapsulation of the "selection" process in the <code>send</code>
 command. That is, <code>send</code> checks the kind of object on which a
 method is invoked and then evaluate the appropriate method directly. In a
 functional approach, this selection is a part of the conditional
 expression that a function from shapes to areas or scenes would have to
 include. 
</li></ol>
 For details on these ideas, see "How to Design Classes", which presents
 the very same ideas using the Java notation. 
</p><hr /><h4>Design II</h4><p>Why it matters to think about immutability: </p><blockquote><myblockquote>
The functional approach may appear unnatural if you're not familiar with
it, but it enables immutability, which has many advantages.  Immutable
objects are simple.  An immutable object can be in exactly one state, the
state in which it was created.  If you make sure that all constructors
establish class invariants, then it is guaranteed that these invariants
will remain true for all time, with no further effort on your part or on
the part of the programmer who uses the class.  Mutable objects, on the
other hand, can have arbitrarily complex state spaces.  If the
documentation does not provide a precise description of the state
transitions performed by mutator methods, it can be difficult or impossible
to use a mutable class reliably.

<h3>The End</h3>

<p>
 This is the end of Bootcamp. You struggled with the material, you lost
 sleep over problem sets, you coped with a random partner, and you tried to
 justify your design in front of harsh critics. You survived and,
 hopefully, you learned something. Indeed, it is my sincere hope that you
 will remember this time as a harsh but productive immersion into
 techniques that can help you in many situations. I hope you do, and so do
 we all from the Bootcamp staff. Good luck with the rest of the MS program
 and your co-ops. 
</p>

<p>
 The rest of the course works like this. Sometime over the weekend you will
 receive your list of grades in your email. If you find that any of these
 grades are wrong, please send email to Stephen Chang, who will discuss
 change requests with the rest of the staff as appropriate. By Tuesday, we
 will sit down and make up final grades (anonymously) and upload them into
 the registrar's database by the end of the week.

Here is one more comment from the panel. Suppose you need a method that
 switches a traffic light from one color to another: 
<blockquote><pre><code>(define traffic% 
 (class object% 
    ...
    ;; String -&gt; Void 
    ;; purpose and effect: change current-state to s
    (define/public (switch-to s) ...)
    ...)

 The use of <font color="red">built-in data definition</font>
 <code>String</code> is, of course, wrong here. You must supply 
 a data definition that restricts the input to <code>switch-to</code>
 appropriately: 
<blockquote><pre><code>
;; A TC is one of: 
;; -- "red"
;; -- "green" 
;; -- "orange"
;; -- "blue"

(define traffic% 
 (class object% 
    ...
    ;; TC -&gt; Void 
    ;; purpose and effect: change current-state to s
    (define/public (switch-to s) ...)
    ...)

 inputs to <code>switch-to</code> and which ones aren't.

Here are the key insights from this week's code walks: 
<ol>
 <li>
  You must respect the design recipe, even though we have moved on to
  classes (e.g., data definitions as classes need interpretations; examples
  and tests are designed before methods; random methods need different kind
  of testing). 
 </li>

 <li>
  You must formulate two kinds of tests for imperative methods: concerning
  things that change and concerning things that must remain the same. See
  blog post from last week. 
 </li>

 <li>
  You must allocate functionality appropriately. For example, when you
  discuss a tank firing shots, you should immediately imagine a function
  with this kind contract: 
<blockquote><pre><code>;; Tank -&gt; Shot</code></pre></blockquote> 
  And this kind of contract tells
  you to which class the method belongs. If you instead add a method to the
  "state of the world" class that uses selectors/getters, you clearly missed the
  point of the course, which tells you to organize your data around problem
  structures and to design your functions around these data definitions.
 </li>
</ol>
 Finally, you must implement criticisms of your code from the panels. If
 you don't, we know that you failed in another key aspect, namely, the goal
 of learning to communicate (which includes listening) about code.

<p>
 You have one more chance to demonstrate that you can explain code and
 listen to criticisms of your code.

 Just to clarify, you are welcome to use <code>local</code> for computing
 local variable bindings, e.g., 
<blockquote>
<pre><code>(define/public (distance x1 y1)
  (local ((define xdelta (- x1 x))
          (define ydelta (- y1 y)))
   (sqrt (+ (* xdelta xdelta) (* ydelta ydelta)))))
</code></pre></blockquote>
 in my lecture notes. 
</p>

<p>
 In case you need to do so, you may initialize super-variables as follows: 
<blockquote><pre><code>
(define a%
 (class object% 
   (init-field x)
   (super-new)))

(define b%
 (class object% 
   (init-field y)
   (super-new [x (some-function y)])))

 The lecture notes from Monday night are now available <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/107-f09/Blog/11/index.html">on-line</a>.
</p>

<p>
 When you design object-oriented programs in the Module language, do not
 use <code>local</code> to define functions. Even if you succeed to process
 objects in such functions, these definitions are unjustifiable and will
 therefore result in <em>huge</em> point losses during code walks. -- You
 may of course use <code>lambda</code> to create functions for processing
 lists.
</p>

<p>
 When you develop examples/tests for imperative methods in stateful
 classes, you must create each test so that it stands on its own. It must
 not rely on the execution of previous tests and it must not affect
 subsequent tests. Here is a skeleton example: 
<blockquote>
<pre><code>(check-expect (local ((define o (new some-class% ...)))
		(begin
		  (send o change-yourself)
		  (send o reveal-something-about-yourself)))
              expected-values-possibly-lists)
</code></pre></blockquote>
 And don't forget to formulate tests for the <em>same</em> sequence of
 commands that shows that no unintended properties of the object change. 
 (With lists you could formulate a single test for this, but it is
 acceptable to use two unit tests instead to separate the concerns.)
</p>

 The topic of tail-call optimization was recently discussed by Guy Steele
 on
 <a href="http://projectfortress.sun.com/Projects/Community/blog/ObjectOrientedTailRecursion">Sun's

 Scheme and co-specified Java. His latest language, Fortress, is an attempt
 to create a highly parallel successor to Fortran with modern OO features

Christos asked me to respond to some questions from the drill club on the
blog. Here we go: 

<ol>

<li> 
  You may continue to assume the existence of built-in data definitions
  such as Number, String, Boolean, and those from the Universe teachpack
  (KeyEvent, MouseEvent, etc). If you happen to need sub-collections of
  those, make a special-purpose data definition and use as before. -- 
  You may even use <code>[Listof X]</code> for a defined <code>X</code>
  in your code. -- For everything else, you will need a class-base data 
  representation.  
</li>

<li>
  You should not need any plain functions for problem set 10, except for
  local (lambda) functions in case you use a <code>list</code> iterator
  (e.g., <code>map</code>, <code>fold</code>, etc.). In case you need a
  novel operations on lists, break the rules. (I can't think of such an
  operation.) 
</li>

<li>
  You may define global constants and global graphical constants. You may
  also define local fields that are constant, which is preferable. 
</li>

<li>
  You must not use any other superclasses than <code>object%</code>. This
  topic hasn't been covered yet, though we will do so on Monday. 
</li>

<li>
  Don't even think of changing code that we provided.  So yes, this leaves
  you with one global function in your program, which we provide.

 solution got a perfect grade. Also, don't use other features than those

 Several people have asked about "letter grades". At this point, it is
 simply too difficult to give you an accurate estimate of your letter
 grade, especially since the last three assignments carry a relatively
 heavy "point weight". Recall though the general guideline for grades in
 this kind of course (briefly discussed in the first lecture): the cut-of
 for A-level grades is somewhere between 85% and 90%; for B-level grades it
 is between 70% and 75%; for a C you will need at least 60%. Also keep in
 mind that we will drop the score that affects your grade most
 negatively. You may wish to design a program to determine this grade,
 because it isn't necessarily the lowest score (in absolute numbers). 
 <strong>There will be no other discussion of final grades.</strong>

 On <strong>recursion</strong>: during the last lecture, someone
 stated that a program was slow because it was recursive. In response I
 gave you a "lecture" on the lack of basic knowledge on the connection
 between proper program design and the implementation of function
 calls. Just in case it isn't clear, this lecture was directed at your
 undergraduate programs in computer science not at you personally. 
</p>

<p>
 As you should know by now, recursion in functions exists because the data
 definition is self-referential or because you had an algorithm idea
 (generative recursion). Since this connection cannot possibly disappear if
 we wish to design systematically, you need an explanation of recursive
 function calls. You already know what to tell a recruiter who asks why you
 would want to use recursion.
</p>

<p>
 In order to provide you with a proper understanding of this topic, we will
 insert two short lectures on the nature of function calls and recursion.
 These lectures should help you overcome the wide-spread preconception that
 "recursion is slow". They will also equip you with the knowledge to argue
 with recruiters, just in case they don't know their basic cs history
 either.

  the first, the last, or all of them. Indeed, you may even wish to let the
  user of the code (as opposed to its designer) choose what to do.

 Christos will run Felix's drill on Monday, and he will code-walk a
 solution to the n queens problem to reinforce generative recursion. 
</p>

<p>
 Also on Monday, Stephen will post sign-up sheets for the remaining code
 walks (8, 9, 10, and 11). 
</p>

<p>
 Some of you have inquired about the schedule for the Thanksgiving
 week. The lectures will take place as normal. You will also receive a
 problem set that is conceptually due on Wednesday before Thanksgiving. We
 will not conduct code walks for these solutions, however. Instead, you
 will receive a supplement to the homework assignment and we will code-walk
 the combined solution. In other words, if you don't design properly, you
 will be in trouble over Thanksgiving; if you do design properly, the
 changes will be straightforward.

 Two comments on today's code walks: 
<ol>
 <li>
  A <strong>termination argument</strong> explains why a generative
  recursive function (or nest of generative recursive functions) reaches
  its <strong>termination condition</strong> for all possible inputs. It is
  <strong>not</strong> a description of the termination conditions. 
 </li>

 <li>
  While it is technically true that a <strong>structural design</strong> 
  is a special case of a <strong>generative recursion</strong>, we consider
  it <strong>wrong</strong> in this course to refer to a structural design
  as a generative one. Unless you have a clear idea that you are going to
  use a generative recursive strategy--which immediately means that you 
  should pay attention to termination--try structural design first. 
 </li>
</ol>
 See the following notes.  
</p>

<p>
 The problem of rendering expressions (a poem of a program of rendering
 things for the web browser and/or text production) will come up at least
 two more times this year. I therefore urge you to take the comments from
 your code walk to heart and to fix it up before you move on. Here are some
 hints: 
<ol>
 <li> 
  Use a structural design, even if the problem statement uses words
  that make it sound like you should use generative recursion. 
 </li>

 <li>
  Find the tasks in the problem statement. Design functions for those. If
  they share auxiliary functions, make those global. 
 </li>

 <li>
  We generally recommend that you develop <strong>everything</strong>
  globally, including accumulator functions. That helps you develop
  examples and test cases for all of your functions. Once you have
  completed the design, re-arrange your program and make things local that
  deserve to be local (at least all accumulator functions). 
 </li>
</ol>
 If you do try to respond to the code-walk panels, I also urge you to go to
 next week's drill club and present your revised solution. 
</p>

<p>
 On Monday, Felix's drill club will re-examine "generative recursion", a
 topic that many of you need to revisit. He will present an alternative
 solution to the "n queens" problem and demonstrate with a concrete example
 how to think about problem generation.

Drill problem 31.3.1 is messed up due to a change to drscheme that happened
a couple of years after we released the book but before the latest version
of the book was released to the web. Specifically, drscheme now understands 
all real numbers (and complex) as <strong>exact numbers</strong> not as
floating points (like in other languages). 
</p>

<p>If you want inexact numbers, your program must compute them (say
  <code>(sqrt 2)</code>) or you must write them into your program. For this
  drill, create an inexact coefficient in <code>g-series</code> like this: 
<font size="-1"><pre><code>(define (g-series n)

Here is a summary of the in-class 'homework problem from last night's
lecture: 

<blockquote>
 Design the function <code>db</code>, which consumes and produces 
 'Foomble' expressions. Its purpose is to replace all occurrences of
 parameters in <code>lambda</code> bodies with names that indicate how far
 away the binding <code>lambda</code> is. Here are some examples from the
 information domain: 
<ol>
 <li><code>(lambda (x) x)</code> becomes <code>(lambda (x) zero)</code>;
 </li>

 <li>for <code>(lambda (x) (lambda (y) (lambda (z) x)))</code>, the
 function returns <code>(lambda (x) (lambda (y) (lambda (z) three)))</code>; 
 </li>

 <li>and for <code>(x (lambda (x) (lambda (y) (lambda (z) x))))</code>, the
 result is <code>(x (lambda (x) (lambda (y) (lambda (z) three)))</code>. 
 </li>
</ol>
 Also recall last night's instructive example. In order to turn numbers
 into symbols, use 
<pre><code>;; Number -&gt; Symbol
;; convert the given number into a symbol
(define (number-&gt;symbol n)
  (cond
    [(= n 0) 'zero]
    [(= n 1) 'one]
    [(= n 2) 'two]
    [(= n 3) 'three]
    [(= n 4) 'four]
    [else 'etc]))</code></pre>
 and don't nest your parameters deeper than five levels. (A real compiler
 pass uses a parameterized data description and replaces symbols with
 natural numbers.)

Here are comments in response to the code walks for week 5: 
<ol>
<li>
 <p>
 In the past we have repeatedly insisted on two points, which appear to be
  in contradiction to each other. On one hand, we have said that data
  definitions should describe sets of values. On the other hand, we have
  said that functions are first-class values, just like any other
  function. Put together, the two ideas suggest that <font color="red">a
  valid data definition may just enumerate a bunch of functions.</font>
 </p>

 <p>
  <font color="red">This is wrong, however.</font> You should only use
  clauses in data definitions for which you can formulate conditions from
  (constant-time) predicates. Since it is impossible to compute whether two
  functions are equal or not (in ISL+ and all other full-fledged
  programming languages), <font color="red">your data definitions may not
  enumerate function values.</font> Instead read the book's chapter on
  abstraction and learn to use the <code>-&gt;</code> data collection
  constructor with which you can describe function spaces.
 </p>

 <p>
  In addition, it is also a bad idea to enumerate specific functions from a
  design perspective. Just recall our discovery of <code>foldr</code>. We
  abstracted from <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code>. If we had used
  the contract "the argument must be either + or *", it would then be
  impossible to use <code>foldr</code> with any other arguments than those
  two. Now that you have seen numerous uses of <code>fold</code>, you
  should appreciate why the proper way to abstract is to use function
  spaces. 
 </p>
</li>

 

<li>
 <p>
  We deducted points from missing attributions of code to previous
  partnerships. While this requirement has always been marked up in red in
  problem set 5, you won't find such nice warning labels in the real
  world. Instead, <font color="red">you will be fired</font> if you use
  code from somewhere else and don't inform your manager; if you are
  running your own company and do something like this,
  <font color="red">you will be sued</font> and that is even more costly.
 </p>
</li>

<li>
 <p>
  Also, last week's blogged solution explicitly stated that you must not
  abstract out recursive or cross-function calls. Some of you did so anyway
  for the X-expression problems. Don't. 
 </p>
</li>

<li>
 <p>
  We saw many misuses of <code>local</code> for mutually recursive nests of
  functions. Here is the proper pattern:  
<pre>
 <code>
   (define (main-f x-changing0 x-always-same)
     (local ((define (lcl-f x-changing)
                 ... x-always-same ...
                 ... (lcl-ggg ... x-changing ...) ...)
             (define (lcl-ggg x-changing)
                 ... x-always-same ...
                 ... (lcl-ggg ... x-changing ...) ...
                 ... (lcl-ggg ... x-changing ...) ...))
       (lclf x-changing0)))
 </code>
</pre>
  <font color="red">Note that <code>main-f</code> is not called from
  within the local nest of functions.</font> Why? For design reasons, it
  would be impossible to re-use the 
  constant arguments (the ones that don't change) without always passing it
  around. You can thus clarify to any reader that
  <code>x-always-same</code> really remains the same throughout the
  computation. For performance reasons, you need to understand that
  <emph>every</emph> call to <code>main-f</code> re-creates all these
  localized functions. This costs time and money. Although the primary
  focus in this course is on proper design and the justification of design,
  you must always develop a sense for the cost of your chosen language and
  you must factor this cost into your design as appropriate. See the book's
  intermezzo on <code>local</code> for details. 
 </p>
</li>

<li>
 <p>
  No program---especially world programs---should be
  run from the Definitions Window. <font color="red">You are to write a
  main function and apply it in the Interactions window to run the
  program.</font> In the future, we will deduct points if you run programs
  from the Definitions Window. 
 </p>
</li>

<li>
 <p>
  <font color="red">Attend drill cub. Use the resources that we
  offer.</font> Many people have made the claim that they don't have the
  time to do the drill problems because they are spending so much time on
  the problem sets. Based 20 years of teaching experience, be advised that
  the opposite is true. <font color="red">You are spending so much time on
  homework problems because you don't solve the drill problems.</font>
 </p>
</li>

</ol>
 You may have noticed that the base score differs from week to week. Over
 the next few weeks, the score will gradually increase. The increases
 reflect the increased complexity of the problem sets as well as the idea 
 that we reward those students who can demonstrate that they learned their
 lessons from previous code walks.

Last night's lecture received the following hint concerning Problem 2.4: 
<blockquote>
I take it that what was meant was to replace

<code>(make-editor String String)</code>

by

<code>(make-editor LOS1 LOS1)</code>

where LOS is a list of 1Strings (1-character strings).
</blockquote>

Today's office hours repeatedly brought up three questions: 
<ol>
<li>
  Q: "where should we write down the answer to the questions which is
  been asked in the problem set 2?" A: Write them down as comments in 
  the solution file for the corresponding question. 
</li>

<li>
  Q: What is non-standard about the conditions in question 2.1? A: Let's
  try again: 
<blockquote>
  "The design recipe demands the use of the same predicate in
   both cond clauses for the main function. Why? How could you simplify the
   design?" 
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
  Q: Should I use a list of two strings for problem 2.4? A: Of course not!
  That's totally silly. Think about the string operations you had to design
  for problem 1.4 and how much easier it is to define these operations
  using lists (of what?).

Prof. Wand sent us the following recommendation: 
<blockquote>
Bring paper and a writing implement to the code review.  During the head
panelist's response you should sit down, remain quiet and take notes.    If
you do not bring paper and writing implement to the review, you will have
points taken off your score.

 We all full-heartedly agree with this statement.

addition, you should either email your solutions to Felix (pnkfelix at

<p>
On a different note: the course now has its own mailing list, which should
make it easier to get responses than individual emails: 
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
The mailing list includes both instructors and the graduate TAs listed on
the course web pages.

 The head panelists requested that for problem set 2 you provide templates
 for all functions via comments: 

<font size="-1">
<blockquote><pre><code>#| TEMPLATE FOR FUNCTIONS THAT PROCESS elements from DD:  

(define (f an-dd) 
  (cond 
    [(alternative1? an-dd) ... (selector-1-1 an-dd) ...]
    [(alternative2? an-dd) ... (selector-2-1 an-dd) ...
                           ... (selector-2-2 an-dd) ...]
    ...))
|#
</code></pre></blockquote></font>

If you need one and the same template for several functions, writing it
down <strong>once</strong> suffices. Indeed, writing it down several times
shows that you do not understand the nature of templates.

<p>Some comments on your code walk performance: 
<ol>
<li>
 Just a reminder that we do not grade on a curve. The grades are assigned
 on an <emph>absolute</emph> scale. 
</li>

<li>
 Almost half of the class received 10 or fewer points out of 20. This score
 corresponds to a <emph>failing</emph> grade. That's the bad news. 
</li>

<li>
 The good news is that the worst code walk doesn't count against your final
 grade and, based on our experience, that most of you will learn quickly
 and improve. To improve, however, means you must <font color="red">sit
 down and study (!= read)</font> the materials that we provide.
</li>

<li>
 The use of "C style braces/parentheses" issue upset one panel so much that
 they deducted points. I have requested that these points are returned to
 you. But, I have amended the  <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/107-f09/Assignments/style.html">style
 sheet</a> and <font color="red">you must use proper parenthesis style or

  general on what we look for in your presentations and how we evaluate
  your 'package.'

<p>
 In addition, please understand that the code review functions according to
 the following pattern: 
<ol>

<li>
 The panelists check out your solutions from svn (saved at midnight on the
 preceding Wednesday), check whether your svn arrangements satisfy the
 required protocol, run a solution, and check some basic
 <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/107-f09/Assignments/style.html">stylistic properties</a>. 
</li>

<li>Each of you gets around 10 minutes to present a program to the
  panel. During this time, we will ask clarifying questions, 'pointed'
  questions (hints that your code and/or your presentation of the code is
  lacking), and questions to direct your presentations. 
</li>

<li>
  The remaining 10 minutes belong to the head panelist. He will diagnose
  each of your code presentations (including the code) and you
  <font color="red">must listen and remain quiet</font> so that you hear what went
  wrong. Ideally you should take notes. Discuss the diagnosis
  <emph>after</emph> you leave the room. 
</li>
</ol>
 If you have questions concerning the diagnosis or if you do not understand
 how to eliminate the weaknesses that the panel diagnosed, see the teaching
 assistants and the instructors during <a href="officehours.html">office

 Now that you have experienced pair programming for 20 minutes, you should
 read up on it and how it benefits companies and academia alike. The 
 <a href="Assignments/index.html">assignments page</a> now has an
 additional tab, which explains pair programming and which points to a
 widely popular article on the technique. We urge you to read it,
 especially if you have doubts, or if you are tempted to split the projects
 after all and to just do things as you have always done them---all by yourself.

Welcome to Bootcamp. 

<p>It is time to get started, and this means for you that you must begin to
  study <a href="../HtDP2e/index.html">How to Design Programs/2nd edition</a>. Notice
  that we didn't use 'read' but 'study' in the preceding sentence. To study
  a text book means to work through the examples (with drscheme in this
  case) and to solve some of the exercises to test your knowledge. Any
  other interaction with a text book is a waste of time.

 burning question on your mind as you start your MS program: 

   <blockquote><em>How am I going to get an A in this course?</em></blockquote><p>We have some news for you: you are beyond college now. In the world of
 technical/professional programs, it really is about <em>what you
 learn</em>, not the grade you can show for it. 
 </p><font color="red" style="italic">Class: </font> Class consists of lectures (CS 
 5010) and labs (CS 5011). Profs. Felleisen (Monday) and Wand (Tuesday)
 will run the lectures.

<p>The TAs will conduct (at most) two lab meetings to introduce you to the
 course software and to familiarize you with some basic conventions. The
 first lab session will be held on 17 (evening session) and 18
 September 2009. Following this introduction, you will present some your
 homework solutions to a panel of assistants during lab sessions. The first
 panels will take place on 24 and 25 September 2009.
</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Computing Environment: </font> We will use
 DrScheme 4.2.N. For most of the course, we will stick to the HtDP teaching
 languages plus the <code>Universe</code> teachpack.  DrScheme is installed
 on the CCS computers. It is also freely available on the Web (see left) in
 case you wish install it on your own computer.
</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Problem Sets: </font> The problem sets have
  three different purposes: to help you understand what you read; to learn
  to design programs systematically; and to help you maintain programs over
  a few weeks. See the Assignments page for details. 
</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Pair Programming: </font> You must work on
 all required problems in pairs.  Your first partner will be chosen from
 your lab section, and your lab TA will assign you a partner. Every few
 weeks, you will get a new partner. Pair programming will be explained in
 the first lab; see the FAQ for a summary. 
</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Theft: </font><font color="blue">
 We will consider <em>all collaborations outside of your assigned
 partnership</em> as <font color="red">theft</font>. We will report all
 incidences of theft to the administration. 
</font>
 In the real world, thieving programmers can bring havoc on their
 companies, which in turn will suffer in court. Our strict and harsh
 course policies are intended to prepare you to function in a world that
 strictly enforces all property rights. 
</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Grades: </font> You will get one grade for
 each homework presentation. We will drop the lowest (as in "worst
 impact") score from this set. Thus, if you choose to skip an assignment
 set or if you just don't get it one week, nothing is lost. The story is
 different for the second or third or ... time.
</p><p><font color="blue">We reserve the right to amend this grading policy
 during the semester.

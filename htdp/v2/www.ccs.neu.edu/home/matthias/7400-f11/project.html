  The purpose of the project is summarized on the
  <a href="general.html">general syllabus page</a>. 
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Stage 1</nbsp></font> Pick a paper that you and your partner
  consider interesting (in the context of this course).  A list of
  suggested papers appears below.  If you would like to be more
  ambitious---recommended to PL students---look at the conferences or
  journals discussed in class. Read the abstracts and motivational
  sections. 
</p><p>Get <font color="blue">approval by 11 October 2011</font> for your chosen
  paper. If your paper is from the list below, a simple email from one of
  you to me, ccing your partner suffices. Otherwise, submit a two-paragraph
  email: one summarizing the paper in your words, and a second one
  explaining why you wish to study this paper. 
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Stage 2</nbsp></font> Read the paper and determine what you
  would like to understand in more depth. Formulate a question and a
  problem statement around the question. Write this up as a one-page
  memo. Explain which tools (Redex and otherwise) you wish to use to model
  the paper and answer your question.  Researchers tend to think of this as
  a proposal. 
</p><p>The <font color="blue">PDFed problem statement is due 25 October
  2011</font>.
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Stage 3</nbsp></font> Just do it! There is nothing like
  working on your chosen topic. Experience the feeling of understanding
  what the author really meant; what the author could have done. -- 
  Do not hesitate to consult with me if you're stuck! 
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Stage 4</nbsp></font> Report on your experience in a revised
  version of the memo; don't use more than two pages. That is, elaborate
  your problem statement because you will have insights that improve
  it. Then add a couple of paragraphs on what you learned.
</p><p>The revised memo is due, in PDF form, 
  <strike>on <font color="blue"> 11 November 2011</font></strike> 
  on <font color="red"> 16 November 2011 (midnight).</font>
  A print-out of the Redex model should be an
  appendix to the memo. Also submit an electronic copy of your model.
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Stage 5</nbsp></font> Prepare a joint 40-minute whiteboard 
 lecture that describes the problem, its motivation, its background,
 the Redex model, and your insight. Divide the talk between the two
 partners but each partner should be prepared to answer questions about
 the entire talk.
</p><p><font color="red"><nbsp>Deliverables and Grading</nbsp></font> Your final deliverables are: (1) the
lecture; (2) two-page memo; and (3) an appendix that documents your project
work.</p><p>
 Your project grade consists of four different pieces: 
<ol><li>the initial formulation of a question concerning the paper; </li><li>the description of your answer or attempts, i.e., the 'revised memo'; </li><li>the in-class lecture; and</li><li>the Redex model in support of your answer.</li></ol>
 Both memos are judged at two levels: the content and its English
 (typos, grammar, unit-level organization). Similarly, the
 lecture is about both content and oral communication skills of
 technical matters. Finally, the Redex model must support the conclusion
 and must show that you have understood the basic modeling techniques. 
</p><p>A note on writing or "<em>less is more</em>." Concise language is
  superior to a lot of weasel words and paragraphs. The two limits (one and
  two pages, respectively) are <strong>upper limits</strong> not lower
  limits. -- Good technical writing focuses on the essence of a topic and
  avoids emotional verbs (e.g., "believe") or judgmental adjectives (e.g.,
  "wonderful"). -- Start a unit of writing with a 'thesis' and use the rest
  of the unit with support of the thesis.  -- Also, use active voice over
  passive voice. Connect sentences by starting sentences with idea-words
  near the ending of the preceding one; then introduce a new one.  Doing so
  is accepted American style of writing and technical writing. -- For a
  short elegant book on writing, see Strunk and White's "Elements of Style"
  (3rd edition).

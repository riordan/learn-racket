 The graded project appendices are in the mail. The grade consists of five parts,
 worth 10 points each. Here are the very rough guidelines: 
<ol>
<li>effort: does the code meet the expectations of your proposal memos/conversations?</li>
<li>correctness: are the functions (e.g., subst) and relations correct?</li>
<li>presentation: do you explain the project, the file, the functions? is it presented top-down?</li>
<li>testing: do you have test suites for functions and relations? do you use redex-chec as appropriate?</li>
<li>usability: can I get simple programs to run in a short amount of time? is the model accessible to a third person?</li>
</ol>
 Keep in mind that these guidelines are rough and that I cannot possibly
 check every corner of the code. 
</p>

<p>
 The average percentage was 88 on this part of the project, which is a pretty
 impressive A- level grade.

 I returned the graded versions of homework 9. Look for 'mf:' in your file
 and study my remarks on your code. Converting a CEK machine to a CESK
 machine is, in principle, a straightforward task and is covered
 extensively in the course text. Hence, the only interesting detail
 concerns the idea that the CESK machine "must use the store to safe-keep
 all values."  In other words, all allocations go into the store.  Since
 <code> cons</code> allocates storage (like <code> new</code> in Java), it
 must reserve a new location in the store and stick a pair into it. All
 other changes--in data representation and processing--follow from this
 insight. 
</p>

<p>In addition: 
<ol>
<li>
  When an instructor blogs about common problems with homework files, 
  please do pay attention. It is unhelpful to have to correct the same 
  mistake over and over again. Your advisor won't like it either. 
</li>

<li>
 The other big problem concerned the management of environments, which is
 still wrong in about a third of the solutions. 
</li>

<li>
 Finally, I once again urge all of you to pay close attention to logical
 consistency.  Logical consistency is critical to programming and modeling
 in computer science, no matter which sub-discipline you choose.

 I returned the graded versions of homework 8. Look for 'mf:' in your file and
 study my remarks on your code. They mark noteworthy points and subtractions.
 The average score is 79, with one perfect score. 
</p>

<p>Here are general points: 
<ol>
<li>
 CEK machine with lists: Since values may contain free variables, your
 'closure' representation for pairs must contain an environment for each
 part. Otherwise you lose variables. 
</li>

<li>
 The addition of exception handlers to the CEK mechanism exploits the <code>K</code>
 register. Raising an exception just means chopping off a part of <code>K</code>. 
 If you instead "bubble" <code>raise</code> expressions through syntactic
 portions of the <code>C</code> register, you are not taking advantage of
 the essential elements of the machine. See the CC machine on page
 136. From there, the standard machine transformations take you to a
 standard homework solution. The best solution would actually keep a stack
 of stacks. 
</li>
</ol>
 In general, when you write down machines or transition systems, you should
 formulate operations on registers via metafunctions, e.g., extending an
 environment, looking up a variable in an environment. When you do create a
 real implementation then, you can keep the machine organization intact but
 replace the operations with efficient versions.

 I returned the graded versions of homework 7. Look for 'mf:' in your file and
 study my remarks on your code. They mark noteworthy points and subtractions.
 The average score is 81, with one perfect score. The grade distribution is
 truly bi-modal. 
</p>

<p>Here are general points: 
<ol>
<li>
 Task 1: When you abstract over two functions, the test is to define new
 versions of the old functions in terms of the abstraction and to re-run
 the tests for the original versions. In addition you can test 
<pre><code>  (test-equal (sum.v1 l) (sum.v2 l))</code></pre> 
 for any list l, etc.
</li>

<li>
 Task 2: As much as you may dislike "Algol" syntax by now, when it comes to
 type signatures for methods and functions, it works just fine: 
<pre><code>  (rec t_ran x_fun(t_dom x_para) e)</code></pre>
 e.g., 
<pre><code>  (rec int f(int x) (if0 x 0 (+ 1 (f (- x 1)))))</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
 Task 3: Since your task is to implement your specification, do not take a
 high grade on this task as a good sign. It merely reflects only your
 approach to programming this task not how appropriate or inappropriate
 your type checker is. 
</li>

<li>
 Task 4: When you admit programs of just numeric type, you know that a
 number can be the only result; the preservation lemma says so. When you
 admit programs of arbitrary type, you need an <code>explain</code>
 function.

 I returned the graded versions of homework 6. Look for 'mf:' in your file and
 study my remarks on your code. They mark noteworthy points and subtractions.
 The average score is around <strike>76, a B</strike> 82, a B+.
</p>

<p>Here are general points: 
<ol>
<li>
 Problem 1 seem to pose two substantial problems. First, several pairs
 "baked" <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> into the language. The
 question asked for ISWIM functions, i.e., functions defined inside the
 language. Second, several pairs extended the calculus semantics (arbitrary
 reductions) and did <em>not</em> create a standard reduction semantics. At
 this point it is impossible to compare the two flavors; they are the same. 
</li>

<li>
 Problem 2 posed a lot of smaller problems. The key is to recognize that
 the addition of new features requires the addition of new syntax (new
 kinds of <code>lambda</code>), new values (both are values), new
 application syntax, and new contexts. 
</li>

<li>I saw a really nice way of explaining <code>mu-lambda</code> without
  redoing all of the substitution function: 
<pre><code>    (==&gt; ((mu-lambda x e) v_1 ...)
         ((lambda (x) e) (create-list v_1 ...)))
</code></pre>
</li>

<li>
 Function application in ISWIM consists of two expressions. In the book and
 in lecture, I whimsically picked left-to-right evaluation order. With the
 addition of multi-argument functions, this choice becomes an even more
 obvious source of potential problems. The addition of assignment
 statements or non-local jumps would definitely enable the programmer to
 write programs that determine the order of evaluation. The question is
 whether programmers can already do so in the flavor of ISWIM you have
 engineered. Here are two possible answers: 
<ol>
<li><strong>externally</strong> If you changed ISWIM in response to
  problem 1 so that it maps stuck states to error answers, i.e., 
<pre><code>  (--&gt; (in-hole E (n v)) error)  ;; for n in number</code></pre>
  an <strong>external</strong> observer can see what is going on
  <em>assuming you have distinct errors.</em>
</li>

<li><strong>internally</strong> Even if you changed ISWIM in response to 
  problem 1 so that it maps stuck states to error answers, a program cannot
  discover the order of evaluation and exploit it for computations. Doing
  so requires the ability <em>to recover from errors within the program.</em>
</li>
</ol>
 My grading on the answers was somewhat loose. No pair came close to the
 above analysis. 
</li>

 The project memos are mostly on point. The average grade on this part is
 85/100, a low A. While this grade is high, it does not mean the memos are
 perfect; I do not have the time to give them same treatment I give to the

<p>
 Your proposal should have either the format of a review (title details
 paper) or the format of a plain paper (body refers to paper, cited in
 bibliography section). -- A proposal consists of three sections. The first
 section summarizes the background, in this case the chosen paper. The
 second one explains the goal, i.e., the research question, you wish to
 tackle. The third and final section lays out a plan of attack; it explains
 methods, tools, and procedures that you wish to use.
</p>

<p>
 When you write a public piece of technical prose, you need to use a formal
 language. Avoid contractions, colloquialisms, bad words such as "thing",
 etc. Also prefer active verbs over non-descriptive verbs (to be, to have,
 to do) and passive phrases. -- As for questions, formulate them 
 <em>indirectly</em> not as <em>direct</em> questions. -- To discuss a 
 paper, refer to its contents (results, methods, tools) not to its
 authors. Indeed, avoid mentioning authors other than as part of a
 citation.

<p>When you define or extend a programming language, you need to develop
  two parts: a syntax and a notion of value. The syntax is intended for
  programmers so that they can write down expressions with the new
  features. The values are for the programmer and the machine. The former
  needs it to reason about the meaning of programs, the latter implements
  it. -- The book and the course covered this idea from week 2 through 5. 
</p>

<p>Since several solutions for problem set 5 suggest that some of you
  didn't understand/appreciate this idea, let me sketch the list extension
  to ISWIM: 
<pre><font size="-2"><code>  (define-extended-language ISWIM* ISWIM
    (e .... ;; surface syntax 
       (cons e e)
       (cons? e)
       (first e)
       (rest e)
       empty
       (empty? e))
    (v .... ;; evaluation syntax 
       empty
       (cons v v))
    ...)
</code></font></pre>
 With this definition, for example, the <code>beta-v</code> law
 <em>automatically</em> applies to lists. There is no need to special-case
 lists or other values, which -- as the book briefly explains -- produced
  all kinds of misunderstandings about PLs in the past. 
</p>

<p>
 The above extension is only one possible way to add lists correctly to
 ISWIM. If you have a correct version and you are happy with it, you are
 welcome to stick to it.

 A number of people had serious problems with problem 3. When you extend a
 language with a data type, you need to extend the set of operations and
 the set of values. That is usually enough. In this case, <code>(cons v
 v)</code> and <code>empty</code> were new values. A typical notion of
 reduction looks like <code>(first (cons v_1 v_2))</code> relates to
 <code>v_1</code>.

 When you communicate a small model to someone/anyone, running a short

<li>
 As the book explains, a normal form is a term that does not contain any
 redexes. A term such as <code>(if0 x (1 + 1) (1 / 0))</code>, however, does
 contain redexes, and I expect a compiler to reduce them as much as possible. 
 Furthermore, <code>(if0 error x x)</code> propagates <code>error</code>,
 while <code>(if0 x error 1)</code> does not.

<p><strong>Some clarification on the next step for your project:</strong>
As you have seen over the course of the past few weeks, scientists ask
questions and try to answer them. Many find such questions while reading
papers.  When they ask question, they usually do not start with questions
that go beyond the content of a paper but questions about the content
itself. It is these kinds of questions that I want you to focus on. You are
<em>not</em> supposed to conduct research in programming languages; you are
merely figuring out what the authors could have meant with statements and
claims in their papers. The one constraint is that you pick questions that
are amenable to the kind of analysis we study in class and you practice in
homework assignments. (Naturally once researchers can answer all questions
about an interesting paper, they move on to novel questions raised by the
paper.)

 Problem 2a caused some confusion. It demands that nested
 <em>expressions</em> are reduced to numbers in a certain order, but it
 does not specify in which order the actual additions happen. As a
 consequence, the model could reduce expressions in left-to-right order and
 perform right-to-left addition after the expressions are reduced to
 numbers. Here is an example:
<pre><code>      (+ (* 2 2) (* 3 3) (* 4 4))
  --&gt; (+ 4 (* 3 3) (* 4 4))
  --&gt; (+ 4 9 (* 4 4))
  --&gt; (+ 4 9 16)
  --&gt; (+ 4 25)
  --&gt; 29
</code>
</pre>
 As a matter of fact, for part c, it is possible to argue that there is no
 distinction.  If your model reduces <em>expressions</em> left-to-right and
 right-to-left but sums up/multiplies all fully numeric operations in a
 fixed order, you can't see a difference.

<p>In general, pay attention to the following: 
<ol>
<li>Include your email addresses on one-line in the header. </li>

<li>Do not include any templates.</li>

<li>Stick to a width of at most 102 chars.</li>

<li>
 Label problems and subproblems in a distinctive manner. Comments with 99
 dashes or large letters work well. 
</li>

<li>Comment out <code>traces</code> and <code>redex-check</code> examples
  with #; comments. 
</li>

<li>Keep (some) tests with functions to illustrate functionality.</li>

<li>Present functions top-down.</li>

</ol>
 This time I allocate 2 points to style and next time it will be 4. 
</p>

<p>
 Here is a sample solution to problem 4, which many of you got wrong. 
<pre><font size="-2"><code>  #lang racket
  (require redex)

  (define-extended-language vStacks Stacks
    (vS mtS
	(push vS n)))

  (define-metafunction vStacks 
    evalS : S -&gt; vS 
    [(evalS mtS) mtS]
    [(evalS (push S e)) (push (evalS S) (e-eval e))]
    [(evalS (pop S))    (popF (evalS S))])

  (define-metafunction vStacks 
    e-eval : e -&gt; n
    [(e-eval n) n]
    [(e-eval (add1 e)) ,(+ 1 (term (e-eval e)))]
    [(e-eval (top S))   (topF (evalS S))]
    [(e-eval (depth S)) (how-deep (evalS S))])

  (define-metafunction vStacks 
    how-deep : vS -&gt; n
    [(how-deep mtS) 0]
    [(how-deep (push S n)) ,(+ 1 (term (how-deep S)))])

  (define-metafunction vStacks 
    topF : vS -&gt; vS
    [(topF (push S n)) n])

  (define-metafunction vStacks 
    popF : vS -&gt; vS
    [(popF (push S n)) S])

  (test-equal (term (evalS ,ex1)) (term (push mtS 1)))
  ... more tests ...

 The key is that two mutually inductive data definitions are processed by
 two mutually recursive functions with recursions and cross-recursions as
 in the data definitions.

 I sent out graded versions of homework 1. Look for 'mf' in your file and
 study my remarks on your code. They also mark my subtractions. In general,
 please pay attention to the following: 
<ol>
<li>A header must include your email addresses. </li>

<li>Use 
<pre><code>  #lang racket 
  (require redex)
</code></pre>
</li>
 to start your file. 

<li>
There is no need to spell out the steps of the design recipe. They exist to
help you find solutions. If you're stuck, be sure to use them.  If you ever
teach programming, be sure to remember them. See sample solution below. 

<p>
 You need to practice formulating concise (one line, 100 chars) purpose
 statements. 
</p>

<p>
 You also need to practice the concise formulation of accumulator
 statements. 
</p>
</li>

<li>Label problems and subproblems in a distinctive manner.</li>

<li>
 Mimic the Redex style from the book to make it look pretty. Many of you
 had extremely ugly style. Here are some hints: 

<ul>
<li>Don't insert extraneous spaces.</li>

<li>
 DrRacket has a natural autoindent functionality. 
 When you hit return, it places your cursor at a 
 certain spot for a reason. If you think it's wrong, 
 you program is ugly and/or wrong. 
 Use the Racket | Indent All menu to format your file. 
</li>

<li>Limit yourself to 102 character-wide lines.</li>

<li>Put all closing parentheses on one line.  No extraneous white
   space. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</p>

 Here is a sample solution to problem 5:
<pre><font size="-2"><code>  #lang racket
  (require redex)

  (define-language Problem5
    (XY x
	(function x XY)
	(XY XY))
    (AB natural
	x
	(function x AB)
	(AB AB))
    (x variable)
    (n natural)
    ;; auxiliary result
    (LL (x ...)))

  (define ex1 (term (function x ((function y (function x (x y))) x))))
  (define re1 (term (function x ((function y (function x (0 1))) 0))))

  (define ex2 (term (x ((function x y) x))))
  (define re2 ex2)

  (define ex3 (term ((function x (x (function y (function z x)))) x)))
  (define re3 (term ((function x (0 (function y (function z 2)))) x)))

  ;; replace variables by static distance 
  (define-metafunction Problem5 
    sd : XY -&gt; AB
    [(sd XY_0) (aux XY_0 ())])

  ;; accumulator: l is the variables encontered between XY_0 and XY  
  (define-metafunction Problem5 
    aux : XY LL -&gt; AB
    [(aux x LL_0) 
     (distance x LL_0 0)]
    [(aux (function x XY) LL)
     (function x (aux XY ,(cons (term x) (term LL))))]
    [(aux (XY_f XY_a) LL)
     ((aux XY_f LL) (aux XY_a LL))])

  ;; determine the distance of the x to its first occurrence in LL plus n
  ;; accumulator: the number of variables between LL_0 and LL 
  (define-metafunction Problem5 
    ; distance : x LL n -&gt; n or x
    [(distance x (x x_1 ...) n) 
     n]
    [(distance x (x_0 x_1 ...) n) 
     (distance x (x_1 ...) ,(+ (term n) 1))]
    [(distance x () n)
     x])

  (test-equal (term (sd ,ex1)) re1)
  (test-equal (term (sd ,ex2)) re2)
  (test-equal (term (sd ,ex3)) re3)
  (test-equal (term (sd ,ex4)) re4)
</code></font></pre>
</p>

<p>
Here is an alternative formulation of distance that relies on the 
full power of Redex pattern matching:
<pre><font size="-2"><code>  (define-metafunction Problem5
    ; distance : x LL -&gt; n or x
    [(distance.v2 x (x_1 ... x x_2 ...))
     ,(length (term (x_1 ...)))
     (side-condition (not (member (term x) (term (x_1 ...)))))]
    [(distance.v2 x (x_1 ...)) x])

  (test-equal (term (distance.v2 x (y z x w x r s))) 2)
  (test-equal (term (distance.v2 x (y z b w a r s))) (term x))
</code></font></pre>
I will introduce some of this power in lecture.

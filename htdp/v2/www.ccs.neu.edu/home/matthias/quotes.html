brought up Democratic. And when I went into politics—as a U.S. congressman,
Bronx borough president and deputy mayor—I did so as a Democrat. Last week,
after more [than] 30 years in Democratic politics, I joined the Republican
Party. </p><p>In recent years I have found myself questioning inflexible Democratic
policies. I have seen a disturbing lack of vision among local Democratic
leaders. As two New York Republicans—Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudy
Giuliani —reinvented and revitalized government, Democratic leaders
doggedly fought to preserve failed, anachronistic policies. </p><p>This inertia has been most evident in their approach to schools. In the
City University system (of which I am vice chairman of the board of
trustees), there are schools like Hostos Community College, where students
not even fluent in English have been awarded degrees. And when I challenge
the practice of social promotion in elementary and secondary schools and
call for academic standards, prominent Democrats attack me. </p><p>This defense of low standards reflects a fundamental Democratic problem:
Many Democrats believe that some ethnic groups, such as Hispanics, should
not be held to the same standards as others. This is a repellent and
destructive concept, a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure. </p><br />
-- Herman Badillo, congressman from New York, in a 1998 op-ed for the Wall --
Street Journal
</blockquote><hr /><blockquote><p>While I have not been here too long, I have noticed that partisan debate is
sharp, and dissent is not always well received. Honest differences of
opinion and principled compromise often seem to be the victim of a
determination to score points against one's opponents. </p><p>But the American people sent us here to be their voice. They understand
that those voices can at times become loud and argumentative, but they also
hope we can disagree without being disagreeable. At the end of the day,
they expect both parties to work together to get the people's business
done. </p><p>What they do not expect is for one party, be it Republican or Democrat, to
change the rules in the middle of the game so they can make all the
decisions while the other party is told to sit down and keep quiet. </p><p>The American people want less partisanship in this town, but everyone in
this Chamber knows that if the majority chooses to end the filibuster, if
they choose to change the rules and put an end to democratic debate, then
the fighting, the bitterness, and the gridlock will only get worse. </p><br />
-- Barack Obama, a senator at the time, speaking in the Senate on April 13,
2005, about the "nuclear option" to change the chamber's filibuster rule

family income, and No. 42 in per capita income. Today, it's No. 48 in both
categories.

</p></blockquote><hr /><blockquote><p>The struggle in the world today for the hearts of and minds of mankind
  is based on one simple question: Is man born to be free, or slave? In
  country after country, people have long know that the answer to that
  question. We are free by divine right. <i>Ronald Reagan, 1982, during the
  crackdown on Solidarity</i></p></blockquote><hr /><blockquote><p>The American Republic will endure, until politicians realize they can

work. My brother and I enjoy it very much as we enjoy Victor Hugo's
Les Miserables. Even, HTDP is easier to understand than many
discourses in Les Miserables(with part on Generative Recursion as the
only exception)." Regards, <i>Eko Hermiyanto</i></blockquote><hr /><blockquote>
I wonder how far Moses would have gone if he'd taken a poll in Egypt? What
would Jesus Christ have preached if he'd taken a poll in Israel? Where
would the Reformation have gone if Martin Luther had taken a poll? It isn't
polls or public opinion of the moment that counts. It is right and wrong,
and leadership--men with fortitude, honesty and a belief in the right 
that-makes epochs in the history of the world. <i>Harry Truman</i></blockquote><hr /><blockquote>

their work, the business community continued to use their finger arithmetic
throughout the tenth century. Abu'l-Wafa, who was himself an expert in the
use of Indian numerals, nevertheless wrote a text on how to use
finger-reckoning arithmetic since this was the system used by the business
community and teaching material aimed at these people had to be written
using the appropriate system.

 integrity that is not lying, but bending over backwards to show that
 you're maybe wrong, that you ought to have when acting as a scientist. And
 this is our responsibility as scientists, certainly to other scientists,
 and I think to laymen. <i>Richard P. Feynman, "Surely you're joking
 Mr. Feynman"</i></blockquote><hr /><blockquote><b>On theory vs practice:</b> Once there were two research
 groups, one American and one French.  The American group had solved a practical
 problem.  The French group looked at their solution and said "very nice,
 but will it work in theory?"<i>anonymous</i></blockquote></div></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><hr width="80%" height="3" /><table width="80%" align="center"><tr><td align="left"><font size="-2">last updated on Sun Jan 11 20:34:01 EST 2015</font></td><td align="right"><font size="-2">generated with <a href="http://www.racket-lang.org/">Racket</a></font></td></tr></table></body></html>

 burning question on your mind as you start your MS program: 

   <blockquote>How am I going to get an A in this course?</blockquote><p>We have some news for you: you are beyond college now. In the world of
 technical professional programs, it really is about <em>what you
 learn.</em></p><font color="red" style="italic">Class: </font> Class consists of lectures (CS G
 107), two lab meetings (CS G 108), and weekly student presentations (CS G
 108).

<p><strong>Lectures:</strong> Every lecture will consist of three parts: a
 one-hour lecture given by students; a one-hour question-and-answer
 session; and a one-hour lecture on other matters. The student lecturers 
 will find out on Tuesday mornings that they have been chosen for the
 lecture that evening. You can volunteer for a lecture, but not for a
 specific week. The lecture will be graded.
</p><p><strong>Labs:</strong> The TAs will conduct two lab meetings to
 introduce you to some of the course software and to familiarize you with
 some basic conventions. The first lab session will be held on Thursday
 evening (18 Sept) and Friday (19 Sept).</p><p><strong>Homework Presentations:</strong> Every week, you will present some
 your homework solutions to two of the TAs. These presentations are
 critical for the learning process and they are key to our evaluation of
 your progress. These sessions will take place in the same computer labs as
 the lab session. 
</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Computing Environment: </font> We will use
 DrScheme 4.1, a programming environment for the Scheme programming
 language, and some dialects of Java. For the first half of the course, we
 will stick to the HtDP teaching languages plus the <code>World</code>
 teachpack.  DrScheme is installed on the CCS computers. It is also freely
 available on the Web (see TAB on the left) in case you wish install it on
 your own computer and use it for work. 
</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Problem Sets: </font> The problem sets have
  three different purposes: to help you understand what you read; to learn
  to design programs systematically; and to help you maintain programs over
  a few weeks. See the Assignments page for details. 
</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Pair Programming: </font> You
 <font color="red">must</font> work on all required problems in pairs.
 Your partner will be chosen from your lab section, and your lab TA will
 assign you a partner. Every few weeks, you will get a new partner.
</p><p>Pair programming means that you and your partner work on the problem
 sets jointly. You read them together and you work on the solutions
 together. One of the lab's purposes is to teach you how to work in pairs
 effectively; indeed, pairs are provably more effective than individuals in
 programming. The rough idea is this: One of you plays <em>pilot</em>, the
 other <em>co-pilot--looks</em>. The pilot works on the keyboard and
 explains aloud what is going on; it is the co-pilot's responsibility to
 question everything. After a problem is solved to the satisfaction of
 both, you <font color="red">must</font> switch roles. 
</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Theft: </font><font color="blue">
 We will consider <em>all collaborations outside of your assigned
 partnership</em> as <font color="red">theft</font>. We will report all
 occurrences to the administration.
</font>
 In the real world, thieving programmers can bring havoc on their
 companies, which in turn will suffer in court. Our strict and harsh
 course policies are intended to prepare you to function in a world that
 strictly enforces all property rights. 
</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Grades: </font> You will get one grade for
 each homework presentation and one grade for your lecture (if you give
 one; your default score for the lecture is 0). We will drop the two lowest
 scores from this set. Thus, if you choose to skip an assignment set or if
 you just don't get it one week, nothing is lost. The story is different
 for the second or third or ... time.
</p><p><font color="blue"> I reserve the right to amend this grading policy
  during the semester. In particular, we may start pre-evaluating
  your homework solutions automatically and assign additional scores.

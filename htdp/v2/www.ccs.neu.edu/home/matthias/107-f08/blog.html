 The primary goal of the final presentation is for you to show the TAs that
 you have learned to improve your design and presentation skills, that you
 have learned from past code walks.

<p>
For your final presentation:
<ol>


<li>

<p>
 For the final project, start with the world and ensure to explain the
 following critical points from the problem statement in your design: (1)
 how the worm moves, (2) how the worm eats, and (3) how the worm dies.
</p>

<p>
 Note: Always keep in mind that design happens top-down (from the "world" to its
 pieces); that coding happens bottom up (and iteratively); and that the
 presentation is again top-down, according to the design recipe.
</p>

</li>


<li>
<p>
 Use the design recipe to build a presentation from your code. Plan to use
 exactly 15 minutes <em><font color="red">total</font></em>. Do not expect
 any guidance from us.  We will pick the "starter" and we will tell you
 when to switch, approximately at the seven-minute mark.
</p>

<p>
 Plan to spend time with your partner on Sunday or Monday to practice these
 presentations. Each partner should practice the entire presentation. 
</p>

<p> Use the design recipe to evaluate the code presentations: first data
 design, then method design. For the former, did the partner explain the
 interfaces and classes, their purpose and their relationships, and is
 there a comment on representing and interpreting data? For the latter, did
 the partner state a purpose, explain critical examples, cover the code,
 show the tests and demonstrate how they cover all crucial points of the
 problem statement?

<li>
<p>
 Bring three copies of an up-to-date class diagram to the presentation. 
 Legible, hand-drawn diagrams are acceptable. Bring an index card along so
 that you can follow through with the design recipe. Of course, it is even
 better to know the process by heart.

 to place the critical <em>examples</em> (not necessarily tests) next to
 the purpose statement, as long as they don't overwhelm your code. You may
 also consider formulating these examples in the world of information not
 data. Make sure to repeat those examples as tests. Even there, tests are

  In last night's lecture I mentioned a book that every working software
  engineer should know. Its title is <cite>Design Patterns</cite> and its
  authors are Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides; it appeared with
  Addison-Wesley. 
</p>

<p>
  Some people also asked me via email about TCO "tail call optimization"
  and the people at MIT. In the early 1970s, Carl Hewitt came up with the
  so-called Actors Model of computation, the first attempt at  a
  theoretical basis for object-oriented programming. The model performs
  method calls in the proper manner, enabling designers to actually use
  object-oriented programming (as opposed to for-loop programming borrowed
  from low-level imperative programming). A couple of years later, Guy
  Steele and Gerry Sussman derived Scheme from Actors. One of the essential
  elements they preserved is the correct way to call methods
  (functions). In the mid 1990s, Guy Steele was also one of the three
  authors who wrote the specification of the Java programming language.
  Guy regrets to this day that he couldn't convince Sun to re-introduce TCO
  into Java. 
</p>

<p>
  Another question that has come up is how to proceed from here. For your
  own benefit, I recommend you take courses in which you can practice the
  major trade of your profession: program design. Other than that, the
  College will rework the curriculum over the next few years to ensure a
  sufficient programming content in all graduate courses.

Here is a frequently asked question (in some form or other):

"Can we manually write deeply nested test cases for 10.1 and 10.2 to stress
test it, or is it mandatory to use a script to generate nested enums? (It
will be really helpful if we can know the levels of nesting expected in
both the problems for stress testing)"
</blockquote>

The answer should be quite obvious. I cannot tell you how large your input
has to be to make sense for you. But you need to create large enough
entries to know that your program performs in linear time, which means that
<blockquote>
doubling the input size must reliably double the running time (at most). 
</blockquote>
Do not rely on a single run or a single pair of inputs to diagnose your
program. Make it run long enough so that you can use your computer's clock
to measure the running time. And of course, you're free to construct those
inputs by hand; I don't care how much time you spent on constructing
inputs.

 I have posted the <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/107-f08/Tmp/10.txt">final code</a> from last night's
 lecture so that you can peruse it in detail. 
</p>

<p>
 The book I mentioned last night is <cite>Mythical Man Month</cite> by Fred Brooks. 
</p>

<p>
 Also, some have asked for a clarification of the meaning of
 <code>Show</code> expressions. First keep in mind that the domain of
 interest here are the boolean expression notations of programming
 languages. Second you can make examples of this expression in your
 favorite language, e.g., Java: 
<blockquote><pre><code>
  boolean show(boolean b) {
    println("show: ".concat(String.valueOf(b))); 
    return b; 
  }

  void main(String argv[]) {
    println("1: " + (true &amb;&amb; show(!true))); 
    println("2: " + (false &amb;&amb; show(!true))); 
  }
</code></pre></blockquote>
 See what adding <code>(show(true) &amb;&amb; x)</code> does.
 Or you can try the following in ASL: 
<blockquote>
<pre><code>
;; Boolean -&gt; Boolean 
(define (show b)
  (begin (printf "show: ~s\n" b)
         b))

(and true (show (not true)))
(and false (show (not true)))
</code></pre></blockquote>

  Also add <code>(and (show (not true)) x)</code> to the Definitions
  window and see what happens. Finally, you must learn to conduct
  this kind of exploration of the "domain" or "world" of interest on
  your own.

<p> I have added some information to problem set 10. As always, it is

<p>Also note that the purpose of a <em>stress test</em> is to determine
  whether your code performs its computation with a reasonable amount of
  space, time, energy, etc. You do not need to predict for stress inputs
  what the expected output is going to be; by the time you run stress
  tests, you should have used test cases to establish that your code
  produces the expected outputs. You should, however, predict some aspect
  of the resource consumption.  For example, when it comes to timing stress
  tests, you should predict how much time a test case needs. If your code
  is expected to run in linear time, then doubling the size of the input
  should double the running time and quadrupling the size of the input
  should quadruple the running time.

arbitrarily deeply nested unordered enumerations -- and the creation of a

<blockquote><img alt="bouncing ball" src="Blog/7.png" /></blockquote>

According to problem 3.4, the red ball might have traveled in a single tick
along the black line to the black position at the closest obstacle (the
bottom wall). There it would have stopped (and switched directions)
according to the problem specification. According to problem 7.2, the ball
switches directions <em>and</em> continues its journey <em>until</em> it
has exhausted its velocity for the one tick. In this example, it travels
all the way to the green position, along the red zig-zag line, bouncing
four more times.

<p>
 Also do recall that the world library defines the notion of a tick as the
 number of times the clock ticks per second, which you can specify via
 big-bang. Your ball-moving function must be able to cope with balls whose
 velocity per tick is as large as the one described in the picture (or even

  discovery that two (or more) existing functions, lines in a conditional,
  test expressions are structurally similar. You then use the
  <em>abstraction recipe</em> to create <em>one common</em> function to
  cover both cases. 
</p>

<p><font color="red">The use of existing abstractions</font> concerns what
  happens <em>after</em> you have created abstractions or <em>after</em>
  you have discovered that the language/library implements abstractions of
  common patterns. The best time to discover this connection is when you
  formulate the template (even if only in your head).
</p>
You will need to work on these skills if you wish to become an excellent
programmer.

  Your homework efforts and your code presentations are not a fight against
  some anonymous system. They are your chance to improve your software
  design efforts based on our feedback.  The diagnostics we used in the
  first two weeks for near-trivial problems suggests that 70-80% of the
  students in this class are in dire need for such self-improvements. Use
  your chances. 
</p>

<p>In this spirit, I must make two specific points: 

<ol>
<li>
 We have noticed some "peculiarities" in homework submissions. Remember
 that we will think of you as <font color="red">thieves</font> if we find
 that your code and the code of some other pair are (near) identical, and
 do keep in mind that it comes much easier to help out honest people than
 <font color="red">thieves.</font> Some of you will receive a detailed
 explanation of this point. 
</li>

<li>
 I also noticed some disrespect for the teaching assistants and their
 explanations during this week's code walks. You must understand that these
 teaching assistants are the very best that this college can offer for this
 crucial course. They fully understand the material; they have taught this
 material numerous times; and they have my full trust. <font color="red">
 Do not interrupt their explanations in the future!</font>
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
 I have made a small, clarifying change to problem 4.4 (on balls).
</p>

<p>
 To help some of you with problem 4.2, I am also providing an adequate 
 data definition for problem 3.1:
<pre><code>
(define-struct join (lft rgt))
;; Mobile is one of: 
;; -- Number 
;; -- (make-join LOM LOM)
;; LOM is one of: 
;; -- empty 
;; -- (cons Mobile LOM)
</code></pre>
With polymorphic data abstraction, we can express this definition more
succinctly with: 
<pre><code>
(define-struct join (lft rgt))
;; Mobile is one of: 
;; -- Number 
;; -- (make-join [Listof Mobile] [Listof Mobile])
</code></pre>
 This is important for those of you who created inadequate representations
 or representations that make it extremely difficult to use existing
 abstractions.
</p>

<p>
 A data definition is adequate if you can easily represent information with
 the data. Here is, for example, the representation for the right-hand side
 mobile from the problem statement: 
<pre><code>
   (make-join (list 7) (list 3 (make-join (list 2) (list 2))))
</code></pre>
 Conversely, given a piece of data you should be able to interpret it as
 information. In this spirit, draw the mobile represented by 
<pre><code><font size="-2">
   (make-join (list (make-join (list 4) (list (make-join 1 1) 4)))
              (list (make-join (list (make-join (list 1 1) (list 2)))
                               (list (make-join (list 2) 
                                                (make-join (list 1) 
						           (list 1)))))))
</font></code></pre>

 For code walk 2, we used the following grade distribution:

 <li> 1 point for test coverage</li>
 <li> 3 points for basic <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/107-f08/Assignments/style.html">style issues</a>;</li>

<p>
 For the next code walk, we will use a slightly different approach to separate
 the properties of the code base from those of your presentation. We will
 approximately divide the point allocation so that nearly half the points are
 for the code base and nearly half for the presentation itself. The points for
 the code base will be averaged between the partners; the presentation points
 remain personal. We will continue to allocate 10% of the points for "partner
 performance".

Here are some first reactions to the "code walks" on Thursday and Friday:

<ol>
<li>
 I have put up a <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/107-f08/Assignments/style.html">style guide</a> for
 programs. I had wronly assumed that your undergraduate institution
 instilled such sensibilities. 
</li>

<li>
 Please study the following and compare them to yours: 
 <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/107-f08/Tmp/2.txt">Solution for Problem 1.2</a> and 
 <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/107-f08/Tmp/4.txt">Solution for Problem 1.4</a>. 
</li>

<li>
 Finally, here are the <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/107-f08/Tmp/grading1.txt">grading guidelines</a> for
 the first code walk. If your code is designed according to the design
 recipe (at a min. HtDP, page xviii) and presented in the same manner, you
 will have no problems getting an A-level grade for such a code
 walk. Believe it or not, following the design recipe actually helps you
 with programming, too. 
</li>

</ol>

</div></blockquote></div><div><hr /><p><b>Thursday, September 25th, 2008</b></p><blockquote><div time="1222348720">

The <a href="Assignments/index.html">Assignments site</a> now contains some
<em>essential hints</em> concerning the Subversion server and especially on
checking whether <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/107-f08/Assignments/svn.html">your homework exists</a> there.

<p>
From now on, the teaching assistants and I will <em>not assist</em>
students who do not use the design recipe. If you have questions, you must
formulate them in terms of the design recipe. Typically such questions are
phrases as "I have done the first N steps of the design recipe but I am
stuck with step N+1." Based on past experience, I suspect that another
typical question is "I am stuck with the template. How do I get from the
data definition to the template again?"
</p>

<p>
In addition, the teaching assistants and I will <em>not assist</em> students who are
obviously not working through the book at the required pace. Keep in mind
that I am <em>not</em> asking you to just read the book, but to read and do
the exercises (except those that involve the draw teachpack; you may wish
to tackle them with the world teachpack instead but they may not be as
useful pedagogically). Daily practice with the book and DrScheme will
ensure that you don't trip over simple syntactic issues.

so that you and your partner can meet after the lab and agree on a first
meeting.</p>

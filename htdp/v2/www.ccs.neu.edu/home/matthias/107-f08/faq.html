Read part I of How to Design Programs, write down questions in the margin,
 and place stickies there. <p>And go get a CCIS account for using the
 Windows, Mac, and Unix computers in the College. That is

 automatically. </p><p>

 In short: learn to speak about technical issues in front of
 small and large groups of peers. Here is a slightly longer
 explanation, including a justification. Design is about
 thinking. When we think on our own without feedback for a long
 time, it is easy to make mistakes early, to overlook them for a
 long time, and to trust in all the decisions we have made from
 the very beginning. We therefore consider it imperative that
 you learn to articulate your thoughts about programs, that you
 are able to explain why you decided to use one strategy and not
 the other, that you can justify your actions on the spot. Only
 when people articulate their thoughts and decision making
 process can others help them recognize and correct mistakes.

 The course uses two text books. The first one is 
 <a href="http://www.htdp.org">How to Design Programs</a>, 
 a book on design in a functional language context. Both text books are
 (or will be) available at the book store. The HtDP text is also
 on-line and includes numerous exercises. If you have time,
 start solving the exercises. 

 The second one is <cite>How to Design Classes.</cite> It is available at
 the Northeastern Reproduction as a bound manuscript; you may need to ask
 for the text for CS U 213.

 Northeastern has created this course to equip all MS students with at
 least the minimal program design knowledge that the graduates of our BS
 program have. Based on experiences with past generations of MS students
 and based on recent feedback from co-op companies, we expect that this new
 course is closer to what MS students bring along and that it prepares MS
 students better for an internship than the old PPL course.

 Exceptionally experienced students may discuss their personal situation
 with the instructor <em>after the first lecture.</em></p></td></tr></table></div></div></td></tr></table><hr width="80%" height="3" /><table width="80%" align="center"><tr><td align="left"><font size="-2">last updated on Tue Jun  9 22:21:18 EDT 2009</font></td><td align="right"><font size="-2">generated with <a href="http://www.plt-scheme.org/">PLT Scheme</a></font></td></tr></table></body></html>

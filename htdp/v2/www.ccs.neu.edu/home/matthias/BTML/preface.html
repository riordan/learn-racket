     <strong>Preface</strong>
<p>
     Programs consume data and produce data; designing a program requires a
     thorough understanding of data. In ML, programmers can express their
     understanding of the data using the sublanguage of types. Once the
     types are formulated, the design of the program follows naturally. Its
     shape will reflect the shape of the types and type definitions. Most
     collections of data, and hence most type specifications, are
     inductive, that is, they are defined in terms of themselves. Hence,
     most programs are recursive; again, they are defined in terms of
     themselves.
</p><p>
     The first and primary goal of this book is to teach you to think
     recursively about types and programs.  Perhaps the best programming
     language for understanding types and recursive thinking is ML. It has
     a rich, practical type language, and recursion is its natural
     computational mechanism.  Since our primary concern is the idea of
     recursion, our treatment of ML in the first eight chapters is limited
     to the whys and wherefores of just a few features: types, datatypes,
     and functions.
</p><p>
     The second goal of this book is to expose you to two important topics
     concerning large programs: dealing with exceptional situations and
     composing program components.  Managing exceptional situtations is
     possible, but awkward, with recursive functions. Consequently, ML
     provides a small and pragmatic sublanguage, , exception , raise , and
     handle , for dealing with such situations. The exception mechanism can
     also be used as a control tool to simplify recursive definitions when
     appropriate.
</p><p>
     Typically, programs consist of many collections of many types and
     functions. Each collection is a progam component or module.
     Constructing large programs means combining modules but also requires
     understanding the dependencies among the components.  ML supports a
     powerful sublanguage for that purpose. In the last chapter, we
     introduce you to this language and the art of combining program
     components. The module sublanguage is again a functional programming
     language, just like the one we present in the first eight chapters,
     but its basic values are modules (called structures) not integers or
     booleans.
</p><p>
     While provides an introduction to the principles of types,
     computation, and program construction, you should also know that ML
     itself is more general and incorporates more than we could
     intelligibly cover in an introductory text.  After you have mastered
     this book, you can read and understand more advanced and comprehensive
     books on ML.

     Acknowledgments
</p><p>
     We are indebted to Benjamin Pierce for numerous readings and
     insightful suggestions on improving the presentation and to Robert
     Harper for criticisms of the book and guidance concerning the new
     module system of ML.  Michael Ashley, Cynthia Brown, Robby Findler,
     Matthew Flatt, Jeremy Frens, Steve Ganz, Daniel Grossman, Erik
     Hilsdale, Julia Lawall, Shinn-Der Lee, Michael Levin, David MacQueen,
     Kevin Millikin, Jon Riecke, George Springer, and Mitchell Wand read
     the book at various stages of development and their comments helped
     produce the final result.  We also wish to thank Robert Prior at MIT
     Press who loyally supported us for many years.  The book greatly
     benefited from Dorai Sitaram's incredibly clever Scheme typesetting
     program SLaTeX.  Finally, we would like to thank the National Science
     Foundation for its continued support and especially for the
     Educational Innovation Grant that provided us with the opportunity to
     collaborate for the past year.

     What You Need to Know to Read This Book 
</p><p>
     You must be comfortable reading English and performing
     rudimentary arithmetic. A willingness to use paper and pencil to ensure
     understanding is absolutely necessary.
</p><p>
     Reading Guidelines  
</p><p>
     Do not rush through this book.  Read carefully; valuable hints are
     scattered through out the text.  Do not read the first eight chapters
     in fewer than three sittings.  Allow one sitting at least for each of
     the last two chapters.  Read systematically.  If you do not fully
     understand one chapter, you will understand the next one even less.
</p><p>
     The book is a dialogue about interesting examples of ML programs. If
     you can, try the examples while you read. Since ML implementations are
     predominantly interactive, the programmer can immediately participate
     in and observe the behavior of expressions.  We encourage you to use
     this interactive read-evaluate-and-print loop to experiment with our
     definitions and examples. Some hints concerning experimentation are
     provided below.
</p><p>
     We do not give any formal definitions in this book.  We believe that
     you can form your own definitions and thus remember and understand
     them better than if we had written them out for you.  But be sure you
     know and understand the morals that appear at the end of each chapter.
</p><p>
     We use a few notational conventions throughout the text, primarily
     changes in typeface for different classes of symbols. Variables are in
     italic . Basic data, including numbers, booleans, constructors
     introduced via datatypes, are set in sans serif . Keywords, e.g.,
     datatype , of , and , fun , are in boldface . When you experiment with
     the programs, you may ignore the typefaces but not the related
     framenotes.  To highlight this role of typefaces, the ML fragments in
     framenotes are set in a typewriter face.
</p><p>
     Food appears in many of our examples for two reasons.  First, food is
     easier to visualize than abstract ideas.  (This is not a good book to
     read while dieting.)  We hope the choice of food will help you
     understand the examples and concepts we use.  Second, we want to
     provide you with a little distraction.  We know how frustrating the
     subject matter can be, and a little distraction will help you keep
     your sanity.
</p><p>
     You are now ready to start.  Good luck!  We hope you will enjoy the
     experiences waiting for you on the following pages.
</p><p>
     Bon appetit! <br>

     <strong>Foreword</strong>
<p>
     This is a book about writing programs, and understanding them as
     you write them.  Most large computer programs are never completely
     understood; if they were, they wouldn't go wrong so often and 
     we would be able to describe what they do in a scientific way. 
     A good language should help to improve this state of affairs.
</p><p>
     There are many ways of trying to understand programs. People often 
     rely too much on one way, which is called ``debugging'' and consists 
     of running a partly-understood program to see if it does what you 
     expected. Another way, which ML advocates, is to install some means 
     of understanding in the very programs themselves. 
</p><p>
     Standard ML was designed with this in mind. There are two particular
     ways-of-understanding built in to Standard ML; one is types for
     understanding data, the other is the module system for understanding
     the structure of the large-scale programs.  People who program in a
     language with a strong type system, like this one, often say that
     their programs have fewer mistakes, and they understand them better.
</p><p>
     The authors focus upon these features of Standard ML. They are well
     equipped to help you to understand programming; they are experienced 
     teachers as well as researchers of the elegant and simple ideas which 
     inspire good programming languages and good programming style. 
</p><p>
     Above all they have written a book which is a pleasure to read; it is 
     free of heavy detail, but doesn't avoid tricky points. I hope you will 
     enjoy the book and be able to use the ideas, whatever programming 
     language you use in the future.

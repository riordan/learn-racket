		If you wish to earn a grade in this course, you must print this Web page, 
		staple the physical pages, sign and date the first page at the top-right, 
          and initial the segments on communication, pair programming, and exams. 
          Your signature acknowledges that you have read and understood <em>all</em> of this 
          page and its special segments.

		Everyone on the course staff is available for consultations to every student.
	</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Class: </font><p><strong>Lectures:</strong> The course has three lecture sections: 
		<blockquote><table border="0" cellspacing="5"><tr><th>Section</th><th>Location</th><th>Professor</th></tr><tr><td>MWTh 09:15am</td><td>SH 305</td><td>Felleisen</td></tr><tr><td>MWTh 10:30am</td><td>SH 305</td><td>Proulx</td></tr><tr><td>MWTh 01:35pm</td><td>FR 201</td><td>Williams</td></tr></table></blockquote>
		You must sign up for one section and make an effort to attend this section 
		on a regular basis. If you (need to) miss a lecture, you're welcome to attend 
          the corresponding lecture in some other section. 
		</p><p><strong>Labs:</strong> The course also has lab sections. The labs start on Monday, September 15.
		You must sign up for a lab section during your first lecture, and you must
		attend this lab section on a weekly basis. The purpose of labs is to 
		give you some hands-on experience with the actual tools, and to 
		explain some of the principles from lecture with hands-on examples. 
		</p></p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Computing Environment: </font>
		 You will do your assignments in DrScheme v205, a programming environment for Scheme. 
		 DrScheme is installed on the CCS computers. DrScheme  is  also freely available on the Web 
		  (see link). You may install it on your  computer at home and work there.
	</p><p>DrScheme runs on most popular platforms (see link). Programs 
		  written in DrScheme have the same behavior on all platforms.  You therefore do not 
		  need to worry what kind of machine you use when you run DrScheme. 
	</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Assignments: </font>	

		There will be 11 homework assignments. The assignments consist of around approximately ten problems, 
		drawn from the book and a supplementary Web page.  We will grade five problems, which we will pick
		randomly <em>after</em> the due date and <em>before</em> the grading. 
     </p><p>
		We will drop the worst homework grade from consideration for the final grade. 
		You may therefore choose to skip one homework set; we'll just assign a zero (0) for this homework. 	
	</p><p><strong>Due Date:</strong> 
		Electronic submissions of your homeworks are (usually) due on Friday at 4:00pm. 
		For exceptions, see the homework page; it also provides a submission link. 
	</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Pair Programming: </font>
	  	You <font color="red">must</font> work on your homework problems in pairs. 
		Please introduce yourself to others in class and find a homework partner as soon as 
		possible.
	</p><p>
		Pair programming means that you and your partner study the problem sets individually and 
	  	possibly even sketch out solutions. Then you meet and jointly develop solutions to each problem.
		One of you--the driver--types, and the other one--the co-pilot--looks over the driver's 
		shoulders. When something isn't clear, it is the co-driver's responsibility to question the approach. 
		You <font color="red">must</font>  switch roles during such a problem solving session. 
	  </p><p>
		You are free to collaborate at will with others on the problem sets. If you do so, you must
		acknowledge all collaborators on your cover page. Failure to do so may result in reductions 
		of your homework grade. 
	</p><p><font color="red">Everyone must be able to solve every homework problem on the due date.</font></p><p><font color="blue">Warning: You must be able to solve every homework problem on your own.</font></p><p><font color="orange">Are you sure you have read the warning?</font></p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Exams: </font> 
		We will have two three hour evening exams to assess your progress:
		<ul><li>16 October 2003 @ 6:30pm</li><li>4 December 2003 @ 6:30pm</li></ul>
		Both exams take place in 10 Behrakis and 310 Behrakis  
 		(building 26 on <a href="http://www.campusmap.neu.edu/"> the campus map</a>) .
	</p><p>
		The exams will test material similar to that assigned in weekly homeworks. You will take the
		exams by yourself. Collaboration is not tolerated.  If you solve every
		homework problem on your own, the exams will be easy. If not, you will probably have a difficult time 
		with the exams. </p><p>
		To provide some discipline, each lab session with start with a quiz on the preceding 
          homework (or lecture material). If you don't answer the questions on the quiz correctly, you will not get 
          a grade for that week's homework set and you are warned that you're not on track. 
	</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Grades: </font> 
		You will get a grade for your homework (factored by the quiz performance)  and 
		a grade for your exams. <em>Both</em>
 		must be passing grades; otherwise you cannot pass the course. For the final grade, we
 		will assign a weight of 35% to the homework grade and a weight of 60% to the two exams.
 		The remaining 5% are up to the instructors' whim.

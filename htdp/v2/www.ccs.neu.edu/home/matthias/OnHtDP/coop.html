 Department at the time, and I had lunch in our conference room. He
 basically told me that full professors teach service courses&#8212;<wbr></wbr>especially
 those who get there after five years&#8212;<wbr></wbr>and that the introductory course
 was waiting for <span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">This thought is a supplement to
<a href="what_is_ts.html" data-pltdoc="x">What is <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span></a>.</span></span></span>  me. This is how I got started with freshman
 courses.  After nine years at Rice, I moved to Northeastern and continued
 the development here.</p><p>At Rice, <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> had a highly local impact. It grew the introductory course
 by a factor of two, even before the web bubble started. But the impact of
 HtDP/<span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> beyond the first course was difficult to discern. I just didn&rsquo;t
 understand the need for a bridge between my first course&#8212;<wbr></wbr>which used all
 of <a href="http://www.htdp.org">HtDP</a> and two more chapters&#8212;<wbr></wbr>and the downstream curriculum. My vision
 for the <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> curriculum had only started to evolve and I think it
 showed. At Northeastern, I was able to implement almost all of it.</p><p>Northeastern is nothing like Rice. Most importantly, it is a co-op
 university. All of our students&#8212;<wbr></wbr>several hundred in each of the two
 shifts&#8212;<wbr></wbr>are required to complete three six-month co-op positions during
 their five years here. Their employers&#8212;<wbr></wbr>Northeastern works with several
 hundred of them, small and large, local, domestic, and international&#8212;<wbr></wbr>
 report back to our co-op faculty who collect a portfolio on each student.
 During these co-ops, these students find out what is useful; what works;
 and what is truly relevant&#8212;<wbr></wbr>as opposed to fashionable.</p><p>Prior to my arrival, Northeastern had been using a standard curriculum
 for two decades: three terms of the currently fashionable language
 (Pascal, C++, Java), using a set of extremely graphics-rich exercises
 intertwined with lessons on practical applications. The curriculum was
 widely published in SIGCSE and related communities, but <span style="font-style: italic">it didn&rsquo;t
work</span>. At the height of the web bubble, only around one third of the
 students got programming co-ops; most others ended up as &ldquo;techies&rdquo; as
 they called themselves: moving computers, running scripts, setting up
 routers and networks, etc. And all of this education cost $150,000
 tuition.</p><p>After a year at Northeastern, our dean asked me to take over the first
 course.  The first instance was a success&#8212;<wbr></wbr>contrary to predictions from
 some local faculty.  Even though it had been considered a trial, we
 switched to the <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> curriculum permanently; the dean suggested that I
 design a bridge course to connect the HtDP course to the rest of the
 curriculum; this started my collaboration on HtDC with Viera Proulx.
 <span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">See the postscript below.</span></span></span> Within a couple of years, I
 started hearing from our co-op faculty that the share of programming
 positions was going up. By 2007&#8212;<wbr></wbr>the last time I was involved with the
 course&#8212;<wbr></wbr>I was told that the ratio of programming on the <span style="font-style: italic">first</span>
 co-op went up to two thirds and higher. In the meantime, all <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> courses
 have been taught by numerous faculty members with rather different
 teaching styles and personalities than my own. The ratio of programming
 co-op has risen to three quarters and more, and all the downstream faculty
 are happy about the students&rsquo; programming skills.</p><p>Surprisingly the story doesn&rsquo;t end here. Also three years ago, our co-op
 employers started complaining that our MS-level co-ops were worse
 programmers than our third-year undergraduates.  The graduate dean would
 regularly forward me these email complaints; at some point I also met with
 two company representatives. Eventually these complaints got so bad that
 the dean asked me whether I could condense the three-semester HtDP
 curriculum into a one-semester &ldquo;boot camp&rdquo; for MS students.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think it is possible to condense the three semesters into one, but
 after two years of experimentation, I have found a way to run a
 one-semester Bootcamp for MS students that mixes essential elements from
 all three courses: the design recipe for FP and OOP programming; practice
 with lots of teaching languages code and some class-based Racket code for
 four weeks; pair programming and code walks. The co-op faculty are
 impressed by the change in abilities. They believe they see more
 satisfaction from our co-op employers. The final jury is still out but the
 deans are happy enough to ask me to expand the <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> curriculum at the MS
 level, too. In the spring, I will start the design of a second-semester
 Bootcamp course.</p><p>Every teacher has stories about the best students, how they found wonderful
 jobs, how they confirmed the teachings with letters and messages. I am
 happy to report that <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> helped hundreds of students, the whole range
 of students&#8212;<wbr></wbr>yes, I do get thank-you notes from some of the weakest
 students&#8212;<wbr></wbr>and an equally wide range of employers.</p><h4>1<tt>&nbsp;</tt><a name="(part._.Postscript)"></a>Postscript</h4><p>The initial improvement in our co-op employment happened over the first
 five years of <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> at Northeastern.</p><p>The recent marginal improvement in our co-op employment coincides with a
 period when Northeastern started raising the SAT requirements for some of
 its strong majors, including computer science.  Hence detractors may argue
 that the most recent co-op improvement is due to the higher SAT score.</p><p>We are experiencing the same development at the MS level. Without changes
 in the GRE score requirements, we see positive developments in our co-op
 interviews <span style="font-style: italic">after</span> deploying the <span style="font-style: italic">TeachScheme!</span> curriculum.</p><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="colleagues.html" title="backward to &quot;HtDP Courses and Colleagues&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;On HtDP&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="what_is_ts.html" title="forward to &quot;What is TeachScheme!&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>

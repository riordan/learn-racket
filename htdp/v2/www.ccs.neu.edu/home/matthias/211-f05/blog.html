Time and again, the TAs and tutors find that people collaborate without
giving proper credit. The result is that they see many identical homework
sets or homework sets with large identical pieces; at the same time, these
homework sets do not name the collaborators and only allude to a
collaboration. This is violates the spirit of the agreement and we will
punish this behavior.

two pairs collaborated but a large number of people did so and then copied

"But if you just look at the surface of people playing games, you are
missing the point, which is that games are all about managing and
manipulating information," Mr. Kerrey [the former US senator and president
of New School] said. "A lot of students that come
out of this program may not go to work for Electronic Arts. They may go to
Wall Street. Because to me, there is no significant difference - except for
clothing preference - between people who are making games and people who
are manipulating huge database systems to try to figure out where the
markets are headed. It's largely the same skill set, the critical
thinking. Games are becoming a major part of our lives, and there is
actually good news in that."

Kronos' Altitude Division produces a software suite for constructing

general architecture of the Altitude suite, with emphasis on the integration
of the components more closely related to our Scheme interpreter. We will
then give an overview of the main implementation techniques used in the
interpreter, related to the goal of extending and integrating Scheme with
our low-level optimization libraries (written in C) and our information
system (written in Java). A demonstration of an interactive application will
close the presentation.

Subject: [plt-edu] idea for recursive data definitions
</pre>

<p />
I have a package of Trader Joe's Vegetable Pad Thai, from the freezer
section.  Not very good -- I don't recommend it as much as I would
most TJ's products.  But it does have one of the best ingredients
lists I've ever seen.  Wait, that's ambiguous.  It's not the
ingredients that are the best, it's the list that is the best.
<p />
Ingredients:
Rice Noodles (Rice Flour, Water, Salt), Sauce (Water, Fish Sauce
[Water, Anchovy Paste, Salt], Fresh Garlic, Teriyaki Sauce [Soy Sauce
{Water, Soybeans, Wheat, Salt}, Brown Sugar, Water, Garlic Powder,
Xanthan Gum, Ginger Powder], Brown Sugar, Lemon Juice, Peanut Oil,
Modified Food Starch, Chili Paste [Water, Chili Pepper, Ground
Soybeans, Garlic, Salt, Sesame Oil], Chicken Base (Chicken [Chicken
Meat, Chicken Extract, Chicken Fat], Salt, Sugar, Maltodextrin [from
Corn], Onion Powder, Celery and Onion Extracts, Turmeric [for color],
Paprika), French Green Beans, Water Chestnuts, Red Pepper, Carrots,
Dry Roasted Peanuts.
<p />
Wow.
<p />
I thought a good exercise for my students would be to make a data
definition for a list of ingredients that would cover cases like this
one.  It took them some thinking, and they eventually came up with
something reasonable.  There were some difficulties, like the "from
Corn" and "for color" being apparently different kinds of things than
the other uses of parentheses, and deciding how to handle those in the
data definition took a lot of work.
<p />
I can see that they missed a close parenthesis somewhere, and I left
it as an exercise for my students to figure out where it should most
plausibly go (I think it should be after Sesame Oil, right after the
close bracket.  But perhaps it goes after Paprika, and then all the
parentheses after Chicken Base ought to be one level deeper [since
they use brackets for parentheses inside parentheses, in the opposite
pattern that mathematicians often use for grouping symbols {as you see
here, in this silly example, where I model my parentheticals after the
ingredients}]).
<p />
Here's what I came up with for some exercises.  I'm sure they could be
stated more clearly; in some cases I should give examples instead of
expecting the students to write them, I'm sure.
<p />
<strong>Exercises:</strong>
<p />
Make a data definition for this list of ingredients.  Make sure to
distinguish in some way between comments like [for color] and
ingredients lists like [Chicken Meat, ...].
<p />
Enter the list of ingredients, using your data definition.
<p />
Write a function to determine how many ingredients there are, that
counts only top-level ingredients and not sub-ingredients.
<p />
Write a function to determine how many ingredients there are, counting
all sub-ingredients as well.
<p />
Write a function that consumes the name of an ingredient and produces
a list of the names of all ingredients that contain it.  For example,
if you give it Soybeans, it should tell you Soy Sauce and Teriyaki
Sauce and Sauce, since they all contain Soybeans as a sub-ingredient. 
Should it also produce Chili Paste, which contains Ground Soybeans?
(Ground Soybeans contain Soybeans, true, but is there any way to tell
your function that and not have it also think that Ground Soybeans
contain Ground?  We need to be careful to distinguish between contains
as an ingredient and contains as a substring.
<p />
Write a function to determine how many different ingredients there are
(for example, counting Water only once even though it appears in many
places).
<p />
Extra credit: For each ingredient (or sub-ingredient), there's a range
of possible amounts of it that could be included.  For instance, in a
list of 5 ingredients, you can be sure that there's at most 1/5 of
each, and that there's more of the first ingredient listed than the
second, and so on.  Write a function that consumes the names of two
ingredients, and produces 'morefirst, 'moresecond, or 'notsure.
<p />
(I still haven't really solved the extra credit myself: I think my
function produces canttell sometimes when it would really be possible
to tell, but it's hard to tell.)

</div></blockquote></div><div><hr /><p><b>Wednesday, November 16th, 2005</b></p><blockquote><div>

Here are two hints for homework 10. 

<p>
First, the first hint concerns the use of <code>world.ss</code> versus
<code>draw.ss</code>. As you may have noticed, the code in the book 
does <em>not</em> (is <em>not</em> supposed to) work with
<code>world.ss</code>. That's part of the problem. I want you to learn to read
documentation (for <code>world.ss</code> and by implication
<code>image.ss</code>) and to learn to use it. The top-level code for the
functions is similar to what is in the book. For example,
<code>sierpinski</code> looks almost the same: 
<pre>
<code>
          ;; sierpinski : Posn Posn Posn -&gt; Image 
	  ;; create an image of the Sierpinski triangles 
	  ;; for the given triangle A, B, C
          (define (sierpinski a b c)
            (cond
              [(too-small? a b c) (circle 1 'solid 'white)]
              [else 
               (local ((define a-b (mid-point a b))
                       (define b-c (mid-point b c))
                       (define c-a (mid-point a c)))
                 (overlay
                  (draw-triangle a b c)	    
                  (sierpinski a a-b c-a)
                  (sierpinski b a-b b-c)
                  (sierpinski c c-a b-c)))]))
</code>
</pre>
The idea was explained in class. Now your task is to figure out how to define
<code>draw-triangle</code> using the functions from <code>world.ss</code>. (I am
doing this so that you can test your drawing functions. With draw.ss you can't
test them.) 
</p>

<p>Second, in my experience students tend to lack knowledge about basic
geometric (trigonometric) functions, which is particularly helpful for problem
27.1.4. Recall the hint: "Think of the problem as drawing a straight line, given
its starting point and an angle in, say, radians." Graphically the situation
looks like this:</p>

<center><img src="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/211-f05/Blog/savanah.jpg" width="350" /></center>

<p>Your given the starting point <code>(x0,y0)</code>, the <font color="blue">length</font>, and the angle <font color="blue">a</font> and you
want to add the red line to the picture. To do so, you need to figure out the
length of the <font color="green">green</font> and <font color="green">black</font> lines. And they are: <code>(* length (sin a))</code>
and <code>(* length (cos a))</code>, respectively. Note that radian means
fractions of pi, e.g., <code>(/ pi 6)</code> for 30 degrees.

  Scott H. asked after class how to write the functions for Additional
  Problem 1. The problem that he encountered is that you must compare
  elements of sets. For example, if you want to work with <code>[Set [Set
  Symbol]]</code>, you need to compare sets to make sure that
  <code>(add-element '(a b c) '((x y z) (a b c)))</code> doesn't add the

From: workmin@...
Subject: [plt-scheme] A game in scheme
Date: October 23, 2005 11:03:03 PM EDT
To: plt-scheme@list.cs.brown.edu

I have written a small game using Scheme and a graphics
library called <a href="http://alleg.sf.net">Allegro</a> from Allegro's site. The game is a
clone of an older game called XQuest I wrote which is
based on Atom Jack's XQuest which in turn is based off
of some old Mac game called Crystal Quest or something.

<a href="http://www.rafkind.com/jon/tar/xquest-0.1.tar.gz">
Download My Game</a>

To play it you need Allegro( http://alleg.sf.net ) and
mzscheme. On UNIX install Allegro like so:

  $ ./fix.sh unix 
  $ ./configure --disable-asm 
  $ make 
  $ make install

Then to play

$ mzscheme -f xquest.ss

The point of this isnt really to write a game but to
show that its possible to use a powerful graphics
library from Scheme in an easy manner, ...

Features of this game include:
* 2 levels
* horrible graphics
* no sound or music
* fun!

<h4>On Scheme: Its Origins, My Role, and Another Voice</h4>

<p>
 Scheme is over 30 years old. It's an MIT product. In 1984, two MIT
 professors wrote a book, dubbed <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">
 SICP</a>, that used Scheme and created a huge buzz. Hundreds of
 universities taught Scheme because it was fashionable. Then, like all
 fashions, these courses disappeared, one after another because the
 instructors didn't understand what was going on.
</p>

<p>
 My research team (PLT) and I reacted to this development in 1994. We
 decided to address all the problems that come with SICP and MIT Scheme. If
 you're interested, the relevant publications are accessible from my
 homepage. Our efforts have re-ignited the "Teach Scheme" movement and
 equipped it with proper foundations.
</p>

<p>
 Just a couple of days ago, someone alerted me to a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/05/10/EndBracket/default.aspx">
  Blog by Don Box</a> on Scheme etc. He is the Microsoft developer who is
  responsible for the COM platform; he also writes excellent books on such
  things. He wrote: 

<blockquote>
"For the past few years,  it has become fashionable to
embrace a dynamic language such as Perl, PHP, Python, or
Ruby. While I'll admit to having a short but pleasurable
tryst with Ruby, I believe I have found true love in the
dialect of Lisp called Scheme."
</blockquote>

 And he proceeded to teach <a href="http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/02/26/6181.aspx">Scheme
 to his kids, over all the other choices he could have made, including the
 standard things</a>.

Here is the promised solution to the follow-up exercise on the morning
lecture. 

<p>Given these structure and data definitions:
<pre>
<code>
(define-struct book (writer title price))
;; A Book is a struct: (make-book Author String Number)

(define-struct author (fst lst yob))
;; An Author is a struct: (make-author String String Number)
</code>
</pre>
write a function that creates a single line for a catalog entry. The line
should contain the authors last name, the title of the book, and the
price. 
</p>

<p>The development of this function up to the template step produces this
  intermediate result: 
<pre>
<code>
;; function examples:
;; ** given:
;; (make-book (make-author "M" "F" 71) "HtDP" 4500)
;; book-string should produce 
;; "F, M. HtDP. 4500"
;; ** given:
;; (make-author "M" "F" 71)
;; author-string should produce "F, M."

;; book-string : Book -&gt; String
;; produce a single line to represent the book 
(define (book-string a-book)
  ... (book-writer a-book) ...
  ... (book-title a-book) ...
  ... (book-price a-book) ...)

;; author-string : Author -&gt; String
;; produce a string from the last and first name of the author 
(define (author-string a-author)
  ... (author-fst a-author) ...
  ... (author-lst a-author) ...
  ... (author-yob a-author) ...)
</code>
</pre>
There are two functions because there are two data definitions. In
principle, you could also add <code>(author-string (book-writer
a-book))</code> in the first definition, because that's how the data
definitions are related.

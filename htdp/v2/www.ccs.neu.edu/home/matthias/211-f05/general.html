		You are in college now. This is your last chance to learn how to learn by yourself, 
		without pressure from parents, teachers, or peers. You want to learn that, because 
		the quality of your life depends on it. Your life. Nothing more, nothing less. </p><p>Now we understand that you want some feedback, both in terms of specific 
		corrections and in terms of a grade. You want feedback so that you can improve 
		your learning process. And we will give you that feedback. It is our end of
		the bargain. Your end is to demonstrate that you actually use the methods and tools 
		for learning that work best in our experiemce. After all, you don't want to waste your
		time, and we don't want to wast ours either.</p><p>So, if you wish to earn a grade in this course, you must print the Course Contract 
 		(see tab on the left), sign and date it, and turn it on the day after the first lab. 
          Your signature acknowledges that you have read and understood the contract and its 
          implications. As long as you will live up to this contract, we will stand by you. 
	</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">People: </font><p><strong>Instructors:</strong><blockquote>Prof. Matthias Felleisen, Prof. Viera Proulx</blockquote></p><p><strong>Teaching Assistants:</strong> 
		<blockquote>Richard Cobbe, Ryan Culpepper, Felix Klock, Theo Skotiniotis, Dimitrios Vardoulakis</blockquote>

			TAs teach labs, supervise the grading of homework sets, hold office hours, 
			and occasionally substitute in lectures. 
			In general, they are apprentice teachers and are here to learn how to run a course.
		</p><p><strong>Tutors:</strong> 
		<blockquote>Janet Wilson, Damien Angelos, Dave Halperin, Matt Horan, Manuel Batista, Mark Ursino, Sarah House</blockquote>
			Tutors hold office hours and group meetings in colleges and labs, 
			grade homeworks and provide feedback about the class's progress. 
			In general, they are undergraduate and graduate students who 
			know that to learn something really well, you need to teach it. 			
		</p></p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Class: </font> Class consists of lectures and lab meetings.

		<p><strong>Lectures:</strong> The course has two lecture sections: 
		<blockquote><table border="0" cellspacing="5"><tr><th>Section</th><th>Location</th><th>Instructor</th></tr><tr><td>MWTh 09:15am</td><td>Shillman 335</td><td>Felleisen</td></tr><tr><td>MWTh 04:35pm</td><td>WVG 108</td><td>Proulx</td></tr></table></blockquote>
		You must sign up for one section and make an effort to attend this section 
		on a regular basis. If you (need to) miss a lecture, you're welcome to attend 
          the corresponding lecture in some other section. 
		</p>

	<p><strong>Labs:</strong> The course also has lab sections, aka CS U 212. 
    	       The labs start on Tuesday, September 13.
		You signed up for a lab section during registration; if you need to change your choice, 
	      you must go to the registrar and change it there.</p>
 	<p>
		You will attend your chosen lab section on a weekly basis. The purpose of labs is to 
		give you some hands-on experience with the actual tools, and to 
		explain some of the principles from lecture with hands-on examples. 
	</p>		

	</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Computing Environment: </font>
		 You will do your assignments in DrScheme v299 (.400), a programming environment for Scheme and 
  		 many other programing languages. We will use the HtDP teaching languages. 
		 DrScheme is installed on the CCS computers. DrScheme  is  also freely available on the Web 
		  (see tabs on the left). You may install it on your  computer at home and work there.
	</p><p>DrScheme runs on most popular platforms (Windows 2000/XP, Mac OS X, Linux). Programs 
		  written in DrScheme have the same behavior on all platforms.  You therefore do not 
		  need to worry what kind of machine you use when you run DrScheme. 
	</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Assignments: </font>	

		There will be weekly problem sets. The problems are 
		drawn from the book and are supplemented with additional problems.  We will grade some 
		but not all problems from each set (picked randomly <em>after</em> the due date). The 
		rest of the work prepares you for the exam. 
     </p><p>
		We will drop the homework grade with the worst impact on your final grade
          from consideration for the final grade. 
		You may therefore choose to skip one homework set; we'll just assign a zero (0) for this homework. 	
	</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Pair Programming: </font>
	  	You <font color="red">must</font> work on your problem sets (2 - 11) in pairs. 
		Your partner will be in your lab, and your lab TA will help you find someone. 
	</p><p>
		Pair programming means that you and your partner study the problem sets individually and 
	  	possibly even sketch out solutions. Then you meet and jointly develop solutions to each problem.
		One of you--the pilot, and the other one--the co-pilot--looks over the pilot's 
		shoulders. When something isn't clear, it is the co-pilot's responsibility to question the approach. 
		You <font color="red">must</font>  switch roles during such a problem solving session. 
		We will practice pair programming in lab. 
	  </p><p>
		You are free to collaborate at will with others on the problem sets. If you do so, you must
		acknowledge all collaborators on your cover page. Failure to do so will result in reductions 
		of your homework grade. 
	</p><p><font color="red">Everyone must be able to solve every
			 homework problem on the due date.</font></p><p><font color="blue">Warning: You must be able 
			to solve every homework problem on your own.</font></p><p><font color="orange">Are you sure you have read the warning?</font></p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Exams and Quizzes: </font> 
		We will have two hour evening exams to assess your progress:
		<ul><li>18 October 2005</li><li>17 November 2005</li></ul>
		Both exams will take place from 6:30-9:30 in Richards Hall (RI) 200 
 		(see <a href="http://www.campusmap.neu.edu/"> the campus map</a>).
	</p><p>
		The exams will test material similar to that assigned in weekly homeworks. You will take the
		exams by yourself. Collaboration is not tolerated.  If you solve every
		homework problem on your own, the exams will be easy.
		If not, you will probably have a difficult time with the exams. </p><p>
		To provide some (self)discipline, each lab session with start with a quiz on the preceding 
          homework (or lecture material). If you don't answer the questions on the quiz correctly,
		 you will not get 
          a grade for that week's homework set and you are warned that you're not on track. 
	</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Course Journal: </font>
		You must keep a course journal on your meetings with your partner(s) and your readings. 
		For details, see the tab on journals. Your journal may contribute to your final grade. 
	</p><p><font color="red" style="italic">Grades: </font> 
		You will get a grade for your homework (factored by the quiz performance)  and 
		a grade for your exams. <em>Both</em>
 		must be passing grades; otherwise you cannot pass the course. For the final grade, we
 		will assign a weight of 35% to the homework grade and a weight of 60% to the two exams.
 		The remaining 5% are up to the instructors' whim and may include "journal checks".

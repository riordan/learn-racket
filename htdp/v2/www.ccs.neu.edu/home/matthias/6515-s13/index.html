  software that consists of many components. Coding techniques include:
  interface specifications for both internal and external components,
  including protocols and contracts; they assume knowledge of program
  design based on data definitions. People techniques include so-called
  code walks, where software engineers present their code for rigorous
  inspection to panels.  Over the course of the semester, students will
  design, implement, and maintain a reasonably large software system in the
  programming language of their choice.
</p><p><font color="black"><strong>MS students:</strong> This course is the continuation of the
   Program Design Principles (PDP) course. While PDP focuses on complete
   program design, this follow-up course concerns the design of components
   and their interaction with a context. Similarly, while PDP teaches code
   presentation techniques, this course expands your role to that of a
   panelist. 
</font></p><font color="black"><p><strong>BS students:</strong> This course extends the learning process
   of Fundamentals I through III (aka Object-Oriented Design) plus one
   co-op; the ideal student is a middler. It is teaches how to transition
   from programming to engineering software with a large-scale project (for
   college-level courses). The course counts in lieu of "Software
   Construction." 
</p><p>
  In addition, this course adds "people skills" to your repertoire. Modern
  software engineering practices require that programmers present their
  code and inspect other people's code. Put differently, programmers must
  learn to discuss their code bases on a high technical level and without
  investments into their egos. This course covers both. You will present
  your code to a panel of three peers, in a class room setting, and you
  will serve as panelist several times during the semester. 
</p></font><p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong>
   The key prerequisite is that you can read and comprehend fragments
   of Java and DrRacket aka "teaching languages" code.

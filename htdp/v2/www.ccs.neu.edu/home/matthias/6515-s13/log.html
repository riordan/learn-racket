 You must take lab notes in a separate note book. Lab notes are basically a
 scientific diary; they describe what you did every day for the course. Do
 <em>not</em> mingle your lab notes with your lecture notes. 
</p><font color="red" style="italic">Purpose: </font><p>
 The general purpose of a lab book is to document your work and your
 collaborations.  If anything goes wrong, it can help you reconstruct the
 past and convince others of your position.
</p><p>
 For this course, the lab book is to help you manage your partnership. You
 must document every meeting: its purpose, duration, accomplishments,
 failures, agreements. 
</p><p>
 You must take these notes on a daily basis. It is probably best if you
 take notes as you prepare projects or complete project steps. 
</p><font color="red" style="italic">Scheduling: </font><p>
 Schedule the first meeting when you agree to partner up for a project. You
 must schedule (when/where) each meeting at the end of the previous
 meeting.
</p><p>
 The ideal schedule blocks out six regular meetings per week, one per work
 day. Even if you agree to such a schedule, re-agree at the end of each
 meeting when you will meet again. See below.
</p><font color="red" style="italic">First Page: </font><p>
 The first page of your lab book is dedicated to information about your
 partner. You should enter the following information on this page: name,
 address, (cell) phone, email address and optionally a screen name if you
 wish to use an IM tool. (Do not use IM to conduct pair programming
 sessions.) Put nothing else on this page.
</p><font color="red" style="italic">Cover Page for Weekly Projects: </font><p>
 Create a project page for each weekly assignment. Enter on this page the
 title of the project, your plan (the steps you anticipate), and a time
 estimate (in minutes) for the project. (If you wish to learn how to manage
 your time properly, estimate the time it takes to take each step of your
 plan.) 
</p><font color="red" style="italic">Pages for Meetings: </font><p>
 Create a new page for each meeting. 
</p><p>
The first three lines of each meeting page must record the following two
items: 
<ol><li>when you met</li><li>where you met</li><li>what you planned to work on</li></ol></p><p>
 The middle of the page is for recording what you accomplished during the
 meeting and any other thoughts you find worthwhile. The last two lines of
 the page should specify when and where you will meet again: 
<ol><li>when you will meet next</li><li>where you will meet next</li></ol></p><p>
 If your partner doesn't show up for the meeting, make a note. Also record
 what actions you undertook to reach your partner. If you sent email, print
 a copy and glue it into your lab book.
</p><font color="red" style="italic">Conclusion Page for Weekly Projects: </font><p>
 Create a conclusion page for each weekly project. Record on the page how
 much time you planned on spending on the project, how much time you
 actually spent, and the ratio.  Note: you won't get credit for accurate
 time estimates. For your own sake, you should be as honest as you can with
 these estimates, so that you learn to estimate how much time real project
 work will consume.

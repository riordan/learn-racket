<p>
 Thanks everyone for a great semester. As always, I enjoyed teaching "Hell"
 and I hope you will be able to distill your intensive work into useful
 lessons (see below). Some of you expressed your desire to sit down with me
 for a chat about life and software once the finals are over. You are
 absolutely welcome to do so. Send me an email to set up a time (I am
 over-booked thru the end of May). You are also welcome to send me
 email if you wish to reflect on the course and your experiences.
</p>

<p>
 In the meantime, relax, enjoy your new-found spare time, and keep
 developing and "reading" software. It is the best way to hone your
 skills.

 I have temporarily put my desktop machine on CCIS X at 192.168.21.178. 
 It runs an Acquire server on port 51234 that waits for four (4) Acquire

 script that signs up four players at once so that you can test your

<strong>"I didn't have time to do this the right way"</strong>

<p>
 How often do I hear this sentence? And it always ends in "and therefore it
 doesn't work (well)."  
</p>

<p>
 What [student] programmers don't understand is that they didn't have time
 because they didn't do it the right way. They constantly confuse cause and
 effect. 
</p>

<p>
 When a programmer skips unit tests for any component, should the
 programmer be surprised to discover that it doesn't work properly? 
 What takes more time? To write the tests in the first place or to find the
 cause of the problem via debugging? Good debugging requires that the
 programmer writes the tests anyway. 
</p>

<p>
 When a programmer rushes headlong into coding a module without stopping to
 wonder about the interface and possible use cases, should the programmer
 be surprised to find out that the module causes others -- including him or
 her at some later time -- to program around the interface's weaknesses? Or
 that the interface causes an undue number of "deep copying" to happen?
 Does it really take less time to study possible use cases for an interface
 instead of creating hacks to get around it? 
</p>

<p>
 When a programmer fails to document an interface of a
 function/class/module and thus forces himself/herself to read the code
 every time the component is to be used? Doesn't this cause a loss of time?
</p>

<p>
 As Barry Boehm said a long time ago, the later you discover a problem, the
 more it costs. If you skip a step in the development of your software, you
 will regret it later -- and you will pay for it with extra time. Check for
 <a href="http://realmofracket.com">"I saved myself an hour of thinking with a
 week of debugging."</a>
</p>

<p>
 It is true. You didn't complete this assignment/task/job properly.  But
 your failure is not due to a lack of time. <strong>Your lack of time is
 due to your decision to go about it the wrong way.</strong>

<p>
 <font color="red">
  As it turns out, at least one pair used the <tt>take turn</tt>
  information as is, so I read the report below to get an idea 
  of how common bugs in protocols come about (tcp suffers from the same
  kind of bug) but <strong>ignore</strong> the reinterpretation of the
  protocol. 
 </font>
</p>

<strong>A Bug in the Protocol? A Change in Interpretation!</strong>

<p>
 Yesterday I discovered a significant problem with the Acquire remote
 protocol.  I am surprised that nobody else has encountered this problem. 
</p>

<p>
 <strong>Diagnosis</strong> When the server sends a <tt>take turn</tt>
 message, it includes the current state of the board and players. These two
 pieces of data do not represent the entire state of the
 game. Specifically, the message fails to include data about the resources
 (tiles, shares) that failed players retained.
</p>

<p>
 <strong>Symptoms</strong> If a player/strategy uses just the data in a
 <tt>take turn</tt> message, it may determine that the banker has certain
 shares in its possession that in reality belong to failed players. As a
 result, it may decide to buy shares that are no longer available, which
 from the perspective of the server, violates the rules of the game. I
 noticed some players failed for this reason in our first attempt to run a
 tournament. 
</p>

<p>
 <strong>It is not a problem</strong> In principle, a player can deduce the
 necessary information across the history of an Acquire game. Specifically,
 since every player receives a notification about the state of the game
 after each turn, it can determine which players dropped out from the
 difference between the last two states it received. It is quite possible
 that some of you implemented your players with this strategy in mind. 
</p>

<p>
 <strong>It is a problem</strong> At the same time, the <tt>take turn</tt>
 message violates the spirit of the protocol, which clearly intends to
 supply a complete picture of the game state at every step. [I had
 originally intended to send a complete state along wherever you see
 <tt>State</tt> and <tt>Turn</tt> in the protocol. My local protocol
 implements this design, which is why the problem could only surface in the
 integration step of the remote game, not in any local test suite.]
</p>

<p>
 I have therefore decided to <strong>re-interpret the protocol</strong> and
 to change my server to send along the <strong>complete list of
 players</strong> in a <tt>take turn</tt> message, including those that
 have dropped out. Syntactically, this re-interpretation does not require
 any change to the protocol, except that the <tt>take turn</tt> message
 no longer represents the order in which players take turns. 
</p>

<p>
 <strong>Disadvantages</strong> If any of your strategies rely on the
 faithful representation of the <strong>sequence</strong> of players in the
 <tt>take turn</tt> message, this re-interpretation of the protocol will
 put your player at a disadvantage. If so, send me the relevant code
 snippet from your player/strategy and I will undo this change to my
 server.

 I revised the specification of the sign-up step somewhat. 
 Given our ultimate goal, players must know about the administrator, but
 the latter cannot know about players. Hence, a sign-up step must include
 the transmission of some information about the player itself from the
 player to the administrator. My revised protocol assumes that the player
 hands over a reference to itself.

<p>
 Last night's code walks suggest serious flaws in some students' thinking
 about program design. Fundamentals I and II/PDP I teach how to design
 programs systematically, starting with a careful design of a data
 representation of the information in the world of interest. I am avoiding
 the term "real" here because really good programming tasks do not involve
 "real" world information but information from the abstract/Platonic realm
 -- for example, decision trees for games or aircraft control or
 self-driving cars or intelligent bomb-destroying robots.
</p>

<p>
 As I explained in my lecture on design patterns, the very same ideas
 emerged from the study of successful, easily maintainable program
 designs. In short, "theory" and "practice" coincide. 
</p>

<p>
 So, when you do design a tree, I would at a minimum expect a diagram that
 lays out the key variants of data in the tree and their relationship: 
<font size="-1"><pre><code>
           ITree &lt;=========================+ 
            | 	 			   |
            | 				   |
            ^ 				   |
            | 				   |        
  +--------------------+ 		   |
  |                    | 		   |
 FinalState      Intermediate              |
                 decisions :: [Action x ITree]
</code></pre></font>
 This simplistic diagram assumes that you recognize a distinction among two
 distinct kind of nodes in the tree: those that represent final states
 where no further action can be taken and those where a player may make
 decision. 
</p>

<p>When confronted with a data definition for tree-shaped (or graph) such
  as the above you need to ask how large these trees really get and whether
  you want to store the whole tree in your program or whether you can
  suspend the generation of a part of the tree until the rest of the
  program must access these parts. To delay a computation, programming
  languages essentially offer one and only one mechanism: called function
  or method or generator in various contexts. The data constructor for this
  mechanism is -&gt; and describes what kind of data is used as input and
  what it computes (whether this is implicit, as in generators or Java's
  self, or explicit in Python's lambdas). 
</p>

<p>Since in our world the widest branching concerns the decision of which
  shares to buy, it is natural to create a method that suspends over this
  point in the tree: 
<font size="-1"><pre><code>
           ITree &lt;============================+ 
            | 	 			      |
            | 				      |
            ^ 				      |

 You can get from the first diagram to the second in two ways. You either
 remember from Fundamentals I/PDP that functions represent large
 collections of data and decisions or you look in the design patterns book
 and find that you need a combination of the composite (tree shapes) and
 command pattern (suspension of action).

 If you want an interesting career in a dynamic and exciting field such as
 engineering software, stumbling across a working program does not
 work. The surviving companies gain an advantage by employing high quality
 software construction methods for software on the critical path and
 keeping employees from this critical path who can't abide by such
 practices. Based on what I know, I consider this assignment a level III
 problem at Google or Amazon for "critical path" software engineers, and I
 do understand the challenges of this assignment, which is why I arranged
 it to be out for a two-week period.

 On April 16, the last day of class, we will run a competition among your
 automated Acquire players. The primary purpose is to give you a chance to
 integrate your remote components into the overall system. The secondary
 purpose is to give competitive natures in this class a chance to
 experiment with game planning. You will get one week to debug your players
 and to hone your players' strategies. The winning pair will receive a
 bonus of 50 points for the project grade component; this is approximately
 one week's worth of points.

 Tonight (March 12) we will again conduct an integration session. Asumu will add
 a folder <tt>project8/integration</tt> to your SVN repository with the
 following content:
<ol>
<li>
 <tt>xrun</tt> is a Racket script that runs a modified version of your
 <tt>game-tester</tt> program on the supplied tests;</li>

<li>
 <tt>largest-alpha/</tt> is a folder with tests like those for
 <tt>game-tester</tt>; 
</li> 

<li>
 <tt>strategy/</tt> is a folder with the two strategy implementations that
 you "ordered" with your specifications. 
</li>
</ol>
 The folder also comes with <tt>xml-diff</tt>, an auxiliary XML diff
 script, tailored to our task that <tt>xrun</tt> uses. You may safely
 ignore it. 
</p>

<hr />

<p>
 <strong>Task</strong> To prepare the integration of the new players, 
<ol>
<li>
 copy your <tt>game-tester</tt> program into this new folder; 
</li>

<li>
 modify <tt>game-tester</tt> so that it runs only players that use the 
 <tt>largest-alpha</tt> strategy.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
 Now integrate the implementation of <tt>largest-alpha</tt> into your
 player. In principle, this should be a function/method call. 
 When your program compiles, run 
<pre> <code> ./xrun </code> </pre>
 to find out how many test cases your program passes. Try to get all of
 them to pass eventually with the code that you received. 
</p>

<p>
 To run individual tests, say, the first one, run this at the Linux prompt: 
<pre><code><font size="-1">  $ ./game-tester &lt; largest-alpha/in0.xml | ./xdiff-xml - largest-alpha/out0.xml</font></code></pre>
 Substitute <tt>1</tt> or <tt>2</tt> for <tt>0</tt> to run the other two
 tests. To run your <tt>game-tester</tt> on just the test input, just use
 the part to the left of the Unix pipe.

<p>
What's a day like for a software engineer at Google? How does it compare to
a company like Microsoft? What's the difference between doing industrial
research, University research, or corporate development? How easy is it to
move from one role to another, one job to another, one company to another,
one industry to another? How much does a software developer use skills
learned as an undergraduate, a PhD student, or a professor? What did you
wish you'd taken time to learn but didn't? Have you ever wondered about any
of these things? Come by for an open, informal, and question-driven
discussion of life after graduation ("in the real world"?). And bring your
questions!  
</p>

<p>
Bio: Jim Miller is a Staff Software Engineer at Google's Seattle office,
working on their cloud platform offerings. Prior to that, Jim spent over
ten years as an architect on Microsoft's Common Language Runtime, and three
years as director of the World Wide Web Consortium's Technology and Society
Domain where he worked on such issues as Internet commerce, security, child
protection, and privacy protection. He's taught at Brandeis University,
MIT, and internally for a number of computer companies. He holds a PhD from
MIT in Computer Science, an MEng from the University of Alaska (Fairbanks)
in Engineering Management, and an SB from MIT in Materials Science and
Engineering. In his spare time, Jim has been a professional opera
chorister, and is currently an amateur singer, commuting bicyclist and avid

<p>
 Your memos bring up one recurring argument that lacks serious
 substantiation, so I thought I would address it in a separate post. 
</p>

<p>
 The basic argument is that "code base A consists of 1,000 lines of code
 while code base B is 4,000 lines long." These numbers are
 plain meaningless. To make the point, let me provide some numbers about my
 code base:  
<ol>
<li>
 The way your tools count, my code base consists of 1,250 lines of code. 
</li>
<li>
 I proudly add that you will find an additional 750 lines of test code
 inside these modules. That is over 50% of the lines of proper code.
</li>
<li>
 Beyond code and tests, I have some 250 lines of comments that specify
 signatures, purpose statements, and some examples for complex functions. 
</li>
</ol>
 This count of 2,250 lines does not include completely optional contracts;
 they contribute some 700 lines (code and comments) so that the actual
 total is around 3,000 lines. Here is an example so that you get an idea of
 what my contracts  check:  
<blockquote>
<pre><code><font size="-1">  [merging-which/t
   ;; which hotels are merged if player places a tile at t on board b
   (-&gt;i ((b board?) (t tile?))
        #:pre/name (b t) "merger spot" (eq? (what-kind-of-spot/t b t) MERGING)
        (result (and/c cons? (listof (list/c hotel? natural-number/c)) (sorted &gt;= #:key second))))]
</font></code></pre>
</blockquote> 
This function determines which hotels are involved in a merger and promises
a non-empty list of hotels and sizes, sorted in decreasing order. 
</p>

<p>
 In this context, I can conduct a thought experiment concerning two
 distinct code bases. First, I could easily present you with the 1,500
 lines of code that make up the code proper and their comments. Based on my
 superficial code inspections, this base may come close to what many of you
 think is a small code base. Second, I could present you all 3,000 lines of
 code. I guarantee you that working with the first code base you would miss
 the tests that illustrate the workings of functions and you would miss the
 guarantees you get from contracts. Both cut down debugging time to a tiny
 fraction of my development effort. In other words, as you would start to
 manipulate the first, small code base, you would dearly miss the other
 1,500 lines. A concise code base is good, but it is not an argument in
 itself for the quality of the code base.

 Every pair should now have a folder with the interface specification for
 strategies. 
</p>

<p>
 Several pairs turned in nothing that remotely resembles a worked-out
 interface. Instead their README points to the interface that they used. In
 those cases, we (1) subtracted a substantial number of points from your
 project 7 score and (2) literally copied the "interface" portion of these
 files into project folders. 
</p>

<p>
 When you attempt to implement an interface, you may need to tease out
 unwritten assumptions and you may wish to point out problems with the
 interface specification and/or code base that goes with it. Consider this
 part of your task as a code walk, except that the authors of the code have
 already left the company. -- Example: your interface may not hand over
 information about the board directly. Instead it may provide a complete
 history of all turns. Feel free to critique this design but since all the
 information exists, go ahead and synthesize a board representation from
 this history.
</p>

<p>
 Next, you may need to make assumptions about the context. Add those to
 your code walk notes. This may include the addition of code snippets that
 should really be defined somewhere else in the code base. Add minimal code
 snippets to the component to make it syntactically correct, but comment
 them properly so that your task masters in the US can easily fix the
 problem. -- Example: you may assume that the code base supplies an 
 alphabetically sorted list of hotels but there is no evidence. Feel free
 to add a code snippet like this one
<pre><code>  ;; -- We expect the code base to supply some constant that 
  ;;    specifies the list of all hotel names in alphabetical order. 

  (define ALL-COMPANY-NAMES '())
</code></pre>
 to the strategy components that you implement. This communicates to the
 specifier what will need to be changed/supplied for code integration. 
</p>

<p>
 In addition to the code, you should therefore supply a 
<pre><code>  comment.txt</code></pre>
 file in which you collect your notes on the code and your assumptions. 
 Organize this file in the form of a code walk memo but use PLAIN TEXT
 not HTML.

<p>
 Running the test fest proved difficult this time.  Several
 misunderstandings crept in, and some old bugs survived in 
 your code base that should have been eliminated by test failures from
 previous weeks. As a result, only <em>one</em> pair turned in a completely
 valid set of tests and only <em>two</em> more passed in a passing test. 
</p>

<p>
 Based on my experience with interface specifications and implementations,
 this result is not surprising. Fortunately, it appears as if most issues
 are easily fixable, assuming your code base lives up to minimal design 
 recipe expectations.  I have therefore added a third task to project 8,
 namely, fixing your code base and test cases.
</p>

<p>
 Reminder 1: the merger bonus is paid at the end of the turn, not during a
 turn. See red blog post from 10 days ago. 
</p>

<p>
 Reminder 2: the initial state is included in the sequence of states. That
 is, your output sequence must start after the tiles have been assigned and
 before the first tile is placed. See blog post from Sunday 2/24. 
</p>

<p>
 Reminder 3: the specification for rounds and cash is "natural number." 
 Some test cases contain cash elements with an amount of <tt>"6000.0"</tt>,
 which the string to number conversions in many languages would interpret
 as a double, not an integer. Use the normal representation of natural
 numbers (counting numbers) that you know from grade school. 
</p>

<p>
 Reminder 4: Use your language's XML libraries to read and write XML
 elements. We found syntactically illegal XML in some expected outputs. 
</p>

<p>Reminder 5: Use simple test cases to establish basic correctness
  criteria of your tests, i.e., tests that you could write by hand. For
  example, the <tt>"rounds"</tt> allows the specification of short
  games: 
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/6515-s13/Tmp/in0.xml">
<font size="-1"><code><pre>  $ ./game-tester.rkt 
  &lt;run rounds="4"&gt;
   &lt;player name="a" /&gt;
   &lt;player name="b" /&gt;
   &lt;player name="c" /&gt; 
   &lt;player name="d" /&gt;
  &lt;/run&gt;
</pre></code></font>
</a>
</p>

<p>By the above, a game of four turns generates a sequence of five
  (color-coded) states for deterministic players: 
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/6515-s13/Tmp/out0.xml">

<strong>Test Cases and Correctness</strong>
Two students discovered a mistake in a test case for project 6. That is,
the test case (seems to have) passed the reference implementation even
though it is inconsistent with the rules of the game. 
</p>

<p>
This discrepancy is possible (though not yet confirmed) in this course and
the real world where Q&amp;A departments supply test cases. It is also
possible in Fundamentals I where the authors of code and test are the same
people. As I point out in my instances of F I/PDP, when an inconsistency
shows up between tests (which specify expected behavior) and code (which
specify actual behavior), it is the responsibility of the programmer to
find out whether the problem is due to
<ol>
<li>the code</li>
<li>the test</li>
<li>both.</li>
</ol>
 In this course it is also possible that you mis-implemented the test
 harness, i.e., the bridge between the code and the test specification. In
 this case, just write off the test.
</p>

<p>Sadly there is the fourth, catastrophic case, when bugs in tests cancel
bugs in code.

<p>
 Someone questioned the implication of my commit analysis, namely, that I
 might release the test harness specification only after the homework is
 due. There are two answers to this complaint.
</p>

<p>
 First, while I understand that students need to pay attention to other
 courses or their day job, you need to understand that programmers always
 juggle more than one project. It is important to acquire the self
 discipline to contribute to every task something on every day. Deadline
 driven programming is bound to lead to catastrophes. Similarly, if the
 chart had shown a peak on Saturday or Sunday before the deadline, I might
 have accepted the excuse that all of you wish to allocate long blocks of
 time to work on the code, because some of you <em>are</em> commuter
 students with full-time jobs. But, as <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/6515-s13/behavior.png">the chart</a>
 shows, the bulk of the commit is coming in on Monday -- which suggests
 deadline driven programming.
</p>

<p>
 Second, projects in the real world do change in the last minute.  I
 consider it my obligation to simulate this experience for you in your last
 course that focuses on programming.  As you know by now, I have released
 the harness specification by now. Still I reserve the right to change
 other specifications as the deadline approaches.

 Jeff and Josh have discovered a serious problem with the specification: 
<blockquote>
While writing our test cases, we discovered what we believe is a problem
with the Project 6 test harness specification. During a Player's turn, they
have the ability to place a tile and subsequently buy stock. If the tile
they choose to place results in a merger, Player's who have stock in hotels
involved in the merger may be paid money if they are a majority or minority
owner. According to the current Acquire rules on the course website, this
payout happens immediately following the merger, and before the Player can
buy stock. Therefore, a Player's ability to buy stock could be changed
based on a merger. However, in the project 6 specification, there is no way
to calculate how much money the current Player may get from a merger, and
therefore the Player's strategy may make an improper decision on what
Stocks to buy. 
</blockquote>
The rules concerning mergers and the test harness are indeed in conflict. 
</p>

<p>
 For now, the resolution of this conflict is that the player places the
 tile and buys stock and <em>then and only then</em> the payout
 happens. This of course means that a player's stock purchase may influence
 the majority owner calculation, but the resolution is the most compatible
 with the specification of the test harness. 
</p>

<p>
 If you still need additional time to adjust to this resolution, send me
 email with an explanation. For valid reasons, I may extend the deadline.

    This design decision can go either way. My own inclination is to design
    a library that data-represents the state of the game not the state of
    the turn. My designs tend to leave the latter task to the rule enforcer
    module, which deals with executing a turn. 
   </p>
   <p>
    In general, remember to figure out where knowledge resides and should
    reside. A data representation of the state maps what is "on the table"
    to data in your language. Rule enforcements are a separate task.

<p>
 <strong>On checking constraints</strong> Since the data representation of
 states is the central piece in a game, you must ensure that none of your
 methods/functions may inject any inconsistency. Thus, while we allowed
 inconsistent and physically impossible board representation for Project 4,
 this time around your library must ensure that the test harness cannot use
 its methods/functions to create an inconsistent game-state
 representation. 
</p>

<p>
 Here are some sample constraints concerning the state, including the
 board: 
 <ol>
  <li>no two hotels must have the same name</li>
  
  <li>no two hotels may touch</li>

  <li>
   no unassociated tile may connect to any two distinct hotels though our
   rules do allow that a chain of unassociated tiles connect two such
   hotels (why? how would such chains come about?)
  </li>

  <li>
   the hotel chains on the board and the hotel chains available to the rule
   enforcer must add up to all available hotel chains 
  </li>

  <li>
   the players must own a legitimate number of shares per hotel. 
  </li>
 </ol>
 Again, these five constraints are samples, and it is your task to
 ensure that your data representation and its methods/functions do not
 allow the creation or mutation of a state that results in
 inconsistent/impossible data representations.

 </font>
</p>

<p>
 <strong>On the results</strong>
 Your first task is to inspect these results and to learn from the failing
 test cases:
<ol>
<li>
<p>
 Your immediate task is to figure out the error(s) in your board
 representation and to fix them so that they don't cause failures in the
 next test fest. (You should expect that a state representation suffers
 from the same flaws as a board representation and more.) 
</p>

<p>
 For this test suite, Asumu has accepted empty hotels on a board, even
 though a regular game process does not allow for such
 hotels. [<font color="red"> But see revised XML specs for project
 5.</font>] In contrast, he did not fix the spelling of hotel names, typos
 in attribute names, and such. Finally, the grammar makes no allowance for
 comments, so Asumu removed them manually. Next time, he will not accept
 comments. 
</p>

<p>
 <font color="red">Also note that the reference implementation did not
 check the legality of the board created from XML. Naturally this will
 change for the testing of states and operations on states.
 </font>
</p>

<p>
In general, he applied a somewhat looser
 standard to this test suite than to the one for graph services in the
 interest of getting you results back. (Meaning, he did not subtract as
 many points as he could have and, in turn, he did not fix as many flaws as
 was possible.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
 Your long-range task is to learn to come up with the kind of "black box"
 tests that your peers came up with. Creating and curating a top-tier test
 suite is almost as valuable as creating the software artifact itself.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
 <strong>On test harnesses</strong> Once again, let me remind (most of) you
 that the purpose of a test harness is to simulate those parts of the
 system that are not yet built and/or should not be integrated yet. The
 former are often but not always software components of the same system
 while the latter could be hardware components (think actuators such as
 airplane wings, rocket launchers, telescope batteries, just to mention a
 few co-op opportunities that I have encountered over the years). 
</p>

<p>
 As such, the harness exists to simulate the surrounding of the library and
 to exercise it from this perspective as much as possible. It does
 <strong>not</strong> exist as an object of interest per se. Hence you
 should see no need whether it can deal with ill-formed XML, invalid XML,
 or other flaws that a typical XML library catches. Always keep in mind
 that these test harnesses could be thrown away while the actual components
 get integrated into the running system.

<p>
Some of you may have noticed a peculiar self-contradiction in project 3. 
</p>

<p>
Recall that <tt>Cost</tt> is defined as <tt>String, a positive real
number in school book decimal notation</tt>. Also recall that a
<tt>path</tt> response comes with a <tt>cost</tt> attribute. This poses a
problem, however, when you compute a path from some node to itself. The
shortest path is a path that contains no edges; indeed, in many graphs this
may be the only such path from a node to itself. The only feasible
cost for such an edge-free path is <tt>0.0</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
The contradiction is then that the cost of an edge must be a positive
number -- it makes no sense to have a cost of <tt>0</tt> for a step --
while the cost of a path can be zero. To avoid this conflict, a software
developer may with to introduce two kinds of cost types to bring across the
difference: <tt>EdgeCost</tt>, which is a positive real number, and
<tt>PathCost</tt>, which is a non-negative real number. Unfortunately, most
programming languages do not support these types, so when you implement
these specifications you are stuck with some form of floating point number
type (<tt>float</tt>, <tt>double</tt>, <tt>long double</tt>). 
</p>

<p>
For your homework solution, we accept costs of <tt>0.0.</tt>.

   What does a test harness executable "do"?

  <td width="300">
   In general, a test harness exists to connect libraries or components to
   external tests. The device is commonly used to build a software context
   for the component in anticipation of integration testing. In this
   course, test harnesses consume test cases from STDIN (until it closes)
   in a data exchange language and produce test outputs to STDOUT. The
   comparison -- if needed -- is performed by another tool in a Unix
   pipeline.

   XML is used in many different ways: as a specification language for all
   kinds of project tasks, as a data storage language (db), and as a data
   exchange language. We use it in the latter sense here. Think of the
   graph server as a read-evaluate-print loop in the sense of DrRacket or a
   Unix shell; you send in an XML element as a request and it sends a
   (possibly invisible) response back. In this context, an XML element is a
   form of data that represents both requests and responses. 

   <p>
    The graph service design emphasizes this idea even more than the graph
    server. There the messages are exchanged over a TCP connection instead
    of a stdin/stdout socket. But in essence, these two ideas are the
    same. (In Racket, they are identified via the idea of ports.)

  The idea of code reviews is due to researchers at IBM Watson, a research

  dissertation on the idea, investigating all kinds of aspects and

 Laurie Williams and Robert Kessler. <cite>Pair Programming Illuminated.</cite> Addison Wesley.

 If you wish to earn a grade in this course, you must perform two tasks
 immediately. First you must figure out how to send email to Asumu Takikawa with
<ol><li><tt>subject: CS6515</tt></li><li>your last name,</li><li>first name,</li><li>your <em>preferred</em> email address,</li><li>and the last four digits of your NU student number</li></ol>
 in the body of the email <font color="red">11 JANUARY 2013</font>. Second,
 you must print this page, sign it at the top-right, and drop it off at
 Mr. Takikawa's desk by the same date. Your signature acknowledges that you
 have read this page, the page on programming (Projects tab), and the rest
 of the site, and that you recognize this web site as contract between you
 and us.

    The course is a "studio" course, a concept that originated in art
    schools. In a studio course, the instructor presents basic techniques,
    discusses domain knowledge for specific projects, and then teaches with
    the help of student presentations.</p><p>
    The purpose of student presentations is for everyone to learn to reason
    about problem analysis, interface and component designs, and code.  The
    presenter will learn to present products to a team, to defend the
    product's design, and to take note of weak spots.  Conversely, the
    listener will learn to analyze and to critique a product, helping the
    presenter uncover flaws. For details on how we will conduct the
    presentations, see the Project page.
  </p><font color="red" style="italic">Final: </font><p>
  In lieu of a final, we will conduct final code walks. If the course
  progresses on schedule, the final code walks will be held during the
  finals examination period. Students in an undergraduate program may
  schedule their final code walk for the final week of class. If the course
  progresses faster than anticipated, all final code walks will take place
  during the final week of class.
</p><font color="red" style="italic">Grades: </font><p>
  The final grades are based on three factors: your project points (50%),
  your active presentations (20%), your panel participation (20%), your lab
  book (9%), and the whim of the instructor (1%).

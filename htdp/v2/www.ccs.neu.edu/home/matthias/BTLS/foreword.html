<h3>Foreword to The Little Schemer</h3>

<p>
In 1967 I took an introductory course in photography.  Most of the
students (including me) came into that course hoping to learn how to
be creative---to take pictures like the ones I admired by artists
such as Edward Weston.  On the first day the teacher patiently
explained the long list of technical skills that he was going to teach
us during the term.  A key was Ansel Adams' ``Zone System'' for
previsualizing the print values (blackness in the final print) in a
photograph and how they derive from the light intensities in the
scene.  In support of this skill we had to learn the use of exposure
meters to measure light intensities and the use of exposure time and
development time to control the black level and the contrast in the
image.  This is in turn supported by even lower level skills such as
loading film, developing and printing, and mixing chemicals.  One must
learn to ritualize the process of developing sensitive material so
that one gets consistent results over many years of work.  The first
laboratory session was devoted to finding out that developer feels
slippery and that fixer smells awful.

    But what about creative composition?  In order to be creative one
must first gain control of the medium.  One can not even begin to
think about organizing a great photograph without having the skills to
make it happen.  In engineering, as in other creative arts, we must
learn to do analysis to support our efforts in synthesis.  One cannot
build a beautiful and functional bridge without a knowledge of steel
and dirt and considerable mathematical technique for using this
knowledge to compute the properties of structures.  Similarly, one
cannot build a beautiful computer system without a deep understanding
of how to ``previsualize'' the process generated by the procedures one
writes.

<p>
    Some photographers choose to use black-and-white 8\times/10 plates while
others choose 35mm slides.  Each has its advantages and disadvantages.
Like photography, programming requires a choice of medium.  Lisp is
the medium of choice for people who enjoy free style and flexibility.
Lisp was initially conceived as a theoretical vehicle for recursion
theory and for symbolic algebra.  It has developed into a uniquely
powerful and flexible family of software development tools, providing
wrap-around support for the rapid-prototyping of software systems.  As
with other languages, Lisp provides the glue for using a vast library
of canned parts, produced by members of the user community.  In Lisp,
procedures are first-class data, to be passed as arguments, returned
as values, and stored in data structures.  This flexibility is
valuable, but most importantly, it provides mechanisms for
formalizing, naming, and saving the idioms---the common patterns of
usage that are essential to engineering design.  In addition, Lisp
programs can easily manipulate the representations of Lisp 
programs---a feature that has encouraged the development of a vast structure of
program synthesis and analysis tools, such as cross-referencers.

<p>
    <em>The Little LISPer</em> is a unique approach to developing the skills
underlying creative programming in Lisp.  It painlessly packages, with
considerable wit, much of the drill and practice that is necessary to
learn the skills of constructing recursive processes and manipulating
recursive data-structures.  For the student of Lisp programming, <em>The
Little LISPer</em> can perform the same service that Hanon's finger
exercises or Czerny's piano studies perform for the student of piano.

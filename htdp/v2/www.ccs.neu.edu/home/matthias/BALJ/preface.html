     <strong>Preface</strong>
<p>

      An object-oriented programming language enables a programmer to
    construct reusable program components. With such components, other
    programmers can quickly build large new programs and program fragments. In
    the ideal case, the programmers do not modify any existing code but simply
    glue together components and add a few new ones. This reusability of
    components, however, does not come for free. It requires a well-designed
    object-oriented language and a strict discipline of programming.
</p><p>
    Java is a such a language, and this book introduces its object-oriented
    elements: (abstract) classes, fields, methods, inheritance, and interfaces.
    This small core language has a simple semantic model, which greatly helps
    programmers to express themselves. In addition, Java implementations
    automatically manage the memory a program uses, which frees programmers
    from thinking about machine details and encourages them to focus on design.
</p><p>
    The book's second goal is to introduce the reader to design patterns, the
    key elements of a programming discipline that enhances code reuse.  Design
    patterns help programmers organize their object-oriented components so that
    they properly implement the desired computational process. More importantly
    still, design patterns help communicate important properties about a
    program component. If a component is an instance of an explicitly
    formulated pattern and documented as such, other programmers can easily
    understand its structure and reuse it in their own programs, even without
    access to the component's source. 
</p><p>
	 The Intended Audience  
</p><p>
      The book is primarily intended for people---practicing
    programmers, instructors and students alike---who wish to study the
    essential elements of object-oriented programming and the idea of design
    patterns. Readers must have some basic programming experience.  They
    will benefit most from the book if they understand the principles
    of functional design, that is, the design of program fragments based on
    their input-output behavior.  An introductory computer science course that
    uses Scheme (or ML) is the best way to get familiar with this style of
    design, but it is not required.
</p><p>
	 What this Book is Not About 
</p><p>
      Java provides many useful features and libraries beyond its
    object-oriented core. While these additional Java elements are important
    for professional programming, their coverage would distract from the book's
    important goals: object-oriented programming and the use of design
    patterns. For that reason, this book is not a complete introduction
    to Java. Still, readers who master its contents can quickly
    become skilled Java programmers with the supplementary sources listed
    in the    Commencement .
</p><p>
    The literature on design patterns evolves quickly. Thus, there is quite a
    bit more to patterns than an introductory book could intelligibly cover.
    Yet, the simplicity of the patterns we use and the power that they
    provide should encourage readers to study the additional references about
    patterns mentioned at the end of the book.

	 Acknowledgments  
</p><p>
      We are indebted to many people for their contributions and
    assistance throughout the development of this book.  Several extensive
    discussions with Shriram Krishnamurthi, Jon Rossie, and Mitch Wand kept us
    on track; their detailed comments deeply influenced our thinking at
    critical junctures.  
</p><p>
    Michael Ashley, Sundar Balasubramaniam, Cynthia Brown, Peter Drake, Bob
    Filman, Robby Findler, Steve Ganz, Paul Graunke, John Greiner, Erik
    Hilsdale, Matthew Kudzin, Julia Lawall, Shinn-Der Lee, Michael Levin,
    Gary McGraw, Benjamin Pierce, Amr Sabry, Jonathan Sobel, and George
    Springer read the book at various stages of development and their
    comments helped produce the final result.  We also wish to thank Robert
    Prior at MIT Press who loyally supported us for many years and fostered
    the idea of a ``Little Java.''  The book greatly benefited from Dorai
    Sitaram's incredibly clever Scheme typesetting program SLaTeX.  Finally, we
    would like to thank the National Science Foundation for its continued
    support and especially for the Educational Innovation Grant that
    provided us with the opportunity to collaborate for the past year.

	  Reading Guidelines 
</p><p>
      Do not rush through this book. Allow seven sittings, at
    least.  Read carefully. Mark up the book or take notes;
    valuable hints are scattered through out the text.  Work through the
    examples, don't scan them. Keep in mind the motto ``Think first,
    experiment later.''
</p><p>
    The book is a dialogue about interesting Java programs. After you have
    understood the examples, experiment with them, that is, modify the programs
    and examples and see how they behave. Since most Java implementations are
    unfortunately batch interpreters or compilers, this requires work of a
    repetitive nature on your side.  Some hints on how to experiment with Java
    are provided on the following pages.
</p><p>
    We do not give any formal definitions in this book.  We believe that
    you can form your own definitions and thus remember and understand
    them better than if we had written them out for you.  But be sure you
    know and understand the bits of advice that appear in most chapters.
</p><p>
    We use a few notational conventions throughout the text to help you
    understand the programs on several levels. The primary conventions
    concern typeface for different kinds of words. Field and method names
    are in    italic . Basic data, including numbers, booleans, and
    constructors introduced via datatypes are set in    sans
    serif . Keywords, e.g.,    class ,    abstract ,    return  and
       interface  are in    boldface . When you experiment, you may
    ignore the typefaces but not the related framenotes. To highlight this
    role of typefaces, the programs in framenotes are set in a   
    typewriter  face.
</p><p>
    Food appears in many of our examples for two reasons.  First, food is
    easier to visualize than abstract ideas.  (This is not a good book to
    read while dieting.)  We hope the choice of food will help you
    understand the examples and concepts we use.  Second, we want to
    provide you with a little distraction.  We know how frustrating the
    subject matter can be, and a little distraction will help you keep
    your sanity.
</p><p>
    You are now ready to start.  Good luck!  We hope you will enjoy the
    experiences waiting for you on the following pages.

     Bon appetit! <br>

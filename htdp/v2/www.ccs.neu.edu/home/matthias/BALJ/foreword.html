     <strong>Foreword</strong>
<p>
      Learning to program is more than learning the syntactic and semantic
    rules of a programming language.  It also requires learning how to   
    design   programs.  Any good book on programming must therefore teach
    program design.
</p><p>
    Like any other form of design, program design has competing schools.
    These schools are often associated with a particular set of languages.
    Since Java is an object-oriented programming language, people teaching
    Java should emphasize object-oriented design.  
</p><p>
    Felleisen and Friedman show that the functional (input-output driven) 
    method of program design naturally leads to the use of well-known 
    object-oriented design patterns.  In fact, they integrate the two  
    styles seamlessly and show how well they work together.  Their book proves 
    that the functional design method does not clash with, but supports 
    object-oriented  programming. 
</p><p>
    Their success doesn't surprise me, because I've seen it in Smalltalk for
    many years, though unfortunately, it seems to have remained one of the
    secrets of object-oriented design. I am happy to see that Felleisen and
    Friedman have finally exposed it.  This book will be especially useful
    if you are a C++ programmer learning Java, since you probably haven't
    seen functional program design before.  If you know functional design, 
    the book will gently introduce you to pattern-based programming in Java.  
    If you don't know it, Felleisen and Friedman will teach you a powerful new 
    way of thinking that you should add to your design toolbox.

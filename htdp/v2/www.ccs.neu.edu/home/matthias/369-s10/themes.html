The following three sample themes illustrate the idea of a theme:
<ul><li>type soundness proofs: 
 <ol><li>Milner, A Theory of Type Polymorphism in Programming</li><li>Damas, Type Inference for Polymorphic References</li><li>Tofte, Operational semantics and polymorphic type inference</li><li>Wright &amp; Felleisen, A Syntactic Approach to Type Soundness</li></ol>
 The focus of this theme is the strategy for proving the soundness of
 type systems, <em>not</em> type inference  and <em>not</em> the problems
 of type inference in the presence of effects. 
</li><li>hygiene in macro systems:
 <ol><li>Kohlbecker, et alii, Hygienic Macro Expansion</li><li>Clinger and Rees, Macros that work</li><li>Dybvig, Hieb, &amp; Bruggeman, Syntactic abstraction in Scheme</li></ol>
 The focus of this them is the mechanism with which macros deal with
 interferences between macro substitutions and lexical scope. 
</li><li>type inference and effects: 
 <ol><li>Tofte, Operational semantics and polymorphic type inference</li><li>Leroy and Weis, Polymorphic type inference and assignment</li><li>Wright, Simple Imperative Polymorphism</li></ol>
 The focus of this theme is the problem of using Hindler-Milner type
 inference in the presence of reference cells (and other effects) and
 strategies for solving the problem. Do <em>not</em> worry about the
 soundness of the type systems. 
</li></ul>
Each set of quasi-citations demonstrates the kind of steps forward that
 research makes. Don't think other themes evolve more quickly than this. 
 Each of the three themes ends in a paper that, in these cases, settled an
 issue (mostly). This doesn't have to be the case, so don't expect your
 favorite theme to "end"; as a matter of fact, "open" themes are a good
 starting point for a first paper. 
</p><strong>Choice of theme:</strong><p>
 I expect <em>senior students</em> to find two themes on their own. 
 Specifically, I propose that you use this opportunity to learn more about
 the background of your dissertation topic. You are welcome, however, to
 choose one of the proposed themes from the list below. 
</p><p><em>Junior students</em> may choose one of the three themes above.
 The price for choosing one of these themes is that you must present during
 one of the first three slots.  Here are some other ideas for potentially
 interesting themes:
<ul><li>early semantics of OOPLs</li><li>types for OOPLs</li><li>control and continuations</li><li>control and control delimiters</li><li>reflection derived from interpretation (3-Lisp, Brown, etc)</li><li>Curry-Howard isomorphism</li><li>type systems for modules</li><li>dependent types</li><li>abstract interpretation</li><li>set-based analysis of programs</li><li>lazy evaluation</li><li>logic programming</li><li>theorem proving</li><li>partial evaluation</li><li>continuations and compilation</li><li>garbage collection</li><li>logical frameworks</li></ul></p><p>
 When you research the literature for your themes, keep in mind that you
 should find reasonably small steps and that the theme doesn't need an
 "end" paper. To turn the papers into a presentation, make sure that you
 (1) establish the connection to PL/programming and (2) bring across the
 necessary background; doing so may take a third of your presentation time
 if the theme concerns some sophisticated mathematics or implementation
 technique.

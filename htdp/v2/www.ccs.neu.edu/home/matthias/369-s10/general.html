      seminar course. You will get out of the course what you put in.</p><p><font color="red" font="italic">Work:</font> You will need to
      choose a pair of "historical" themes of your choice. For each theme,
      you will need to find a set of three to five papers (1960-2005) that
      introduce and evolve the idea; you will need to read and digest those
      papers; you will need to turn the central ideas of all the papers
      into a coherent lecture; and you will need to take notes for the
      discussions after these presentations. </p><p><font color="red" font="italic">Reading:</font> You will need to
         read a fair amount. <em>Reading</em> means working through a text,
         figuring out the key innovation in the paper, and making up and
         working through examples that help you understand the innovations.
      </p><p><font color="red" font="italic">Writing:</font> You will also need
         to write a fair amount. Specifically, you will write an annotated
         bibliography entry for each of your two themes.  A complete entry
         consists of the bibtex information plus two paragraphs: one that
         summarizes the paper and one that explains its novelty. (This is
         approximately the format of a conference review for a paper,
         though conference reviews should also come with specific
         suggestions for improving a paper.) Email me the pdf of your
         annotated bibliography at least one day before your presentation. 
      </p><p><font color="red" font="italic">Presentation:</font> You will also
         need to give a presentation on each theme. A presentation should
         take approximately 70 minutes, leaving 15 minutes for discussion
         (during and after your presentation).  Start the presentation by
         handing out copies of the annotated bibliography for the theme.
         Make sure the presentation includes a background/problem
         description (where did the authors start from?) and an explanation
         of the essential contributions (what did this paper improve over
         the previous one?  how do they differ?) of each paper.
      </p><p>To help you prepare the presentation, you will work in
      pairs. Proof-read each others' annotated bibliographies; practice
      your presentations with each other. Your peers will anonymously
      evaluate your presentation with the help of the following evaluation
      sheet:
	<center><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/369-s10/eval.pdf">evaluation sheet (PDF)</a></center></p><p><font color="red" font="italic">Grades:</font> You will get real
      grades and "PhD grades" (A for average, B for Bad, etc). The real
      grades will consist of six components: one grade per annotated
      bibliography; one per presentation; and one grade per
      bibliography-presentation from your peers.

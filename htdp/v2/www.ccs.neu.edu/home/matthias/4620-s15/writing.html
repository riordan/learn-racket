skills. Even people who wish to focus on the technical aspects of their
work must relate to others, both in oral and written form. You will
practice your technical articulation skills in class. If you need help with
writing, consider the following two books:

</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ol><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">units of writing (2)</span> Every unit of writing comes with a thesis
and support of the thesis. For example, an essay&rsquo;s first paragraph states
the essay&rsquo;s thesis and (often implicitly) sets up the remaining paragraphs
with key words and phrases. Each remaining paragraph&rsquo;s first sentence can
then state a thesis in terms of these words. The remaining sentences in
turn support the paragraph&rsquo;s thesis with examples, illustrations, abstract
and logical arguments.</p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">flow and style</span> (3) Within a paragraph, all sentences belong to
one theme and connect to each other. On occasion, this connection may use
<span style="font-style: italic">fill words</span> such as "in addition" or "similarly." In general, with
content- and even word-based connection. Such connections end a sentence in
an idea/word that the following sentence picks up near the beginning. The
second sentence leas from there to the next idea/key word.</p><p>When someone requests a description of an object&#8212;<wbr></wbr>concrete or
abstract&#8212;<wbr></wbr>avoid subjective language. In a technical context, avoid flowery
or poetic language, though sparsely used exceptions often work well. Also,
avoid the use of future tense in descriptions. When you describe an object
in the hear and now, the description states an eternal truths, fixed in
time and space. An exception is a description of (possible) future
developments of an evolving object.</p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">grammatical mistakes and typos (3)</span></p><p>Just one note here: Do not use contractions; it is too easy to make
mistakes that way, e.g., the misuse of "it&rsquo;s" as a possessive. Learn from
Ms. Biron&rsquo;s feedback.</p></li><li><p><span style="font-weight: bold">content (2)</span> <span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">In the context of programming
languages, the word "power" has one specific meaning that is almost never
useful. According to Alan Turing and Alonzo Church (two early computer
scientists), all programming languages have approximately the same power,
which basically means that they can compute the same set of functions on
numbers that Turing machines or the Lambda Calculus over numbers can
compute. In a
<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/#scp91-felleisen">technical
paper</a>, I explain that/how this meaning is irrelevant for programmers and
that one could use other means to compare languages. While my kind of
comparison comes closer to the eternally-mentioned, never-explained idea of
"expressive power of my language," it fails to match the modern perception,
which also includes libraries, frameworks, supported platforms,
implementations, IDES, and even elements o the tool chain.</span></span></span>  Stick to the
suggested topic. Understand what the subject is about.  Know your words and
terminology. The same is true for ideas. Make sure you understand an
idea/word/term before you use it.</p><p>When you are
asked to describe the most distinguishing feature of your favorite object,
do not describe how it has changed the world&rsquo;s history. Instead, focus on
objective properties. In the specific case, your favorite languages may
support classes, objects, and first-class, higher-order functions. It may
also come with a wealth of frameworks and libraries. Or its implementation
may sport a read-eval-print loop, like Lisp languages have since 1958. All
of these are features of the language and its eco-system. Now contrast such
features with properties of the language such as "readable" or "productive"
or "powerful." Such adjectives are clearly subjective and judge the
language from your personal perspective. Whether someone else agrees with
these attributions is open. See the course announcements for "red" and
"beautiful."</p></li></ol></div><div class="SIntrapara">The memos are graded on a scale of 10 points. The number in parentheses

 solving.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">Set up the content w/o wasting space on details.</span></span></span> It
 achieves this novel with three innovations: a highly expressive syntax
 extension system, powerful software contracts, and the linguistic
 internalization of systems-programming idioms.</p><p>Racket&rsquo;s syntax system acknowledges the idea that every problem area
 deserves its own language. Using Racket, a programmer can quickly create a
 language that, at a minimum, allows the expression of solutions in terms
 accessible to experts in the problem domain or, even better, allows them to
 describe problems and thus to abstract over a range of possible solutions.
 Systems in Racket compose communicating software components, with each
 component formulated in the most appropriate domain-specific language.</p><p>When software systems consists of multi-lingual collections of
 <span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">Connect paragraph, via ideas and words.</span></span></span>  components, their
 communications must respect the invariants of each and every domain-specific
 language used. When a value flows from one component written in language
 <span class="stt">L</span> to a component that uses language <span class="stt">L2</span>, it must be protected from
 operations in the latter that may violate its integrity. Racket&rsquo;s innovative
 higher-order contract system can implement such protection mechanisms and,
 when violations do occur, can point directly to the guilty party. One prime
 example of this form of integration is Racket and Typed Racket, the world&rsquo;s
 first gradually typed programming language.</p><p>Many problem domains<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">Hark back to paragraph 1</span></span></span> call for dynamic
 solutions, i.e., processes that dynamically load programs from potentially
 unknown sources. For such systems, a language must support the safe and
 secure administration of resources, and to this end, Racket internalizes
 systems-level idioms via linguistic features. Using these<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">Link
sentences via words end-to-front.</span></span></span>  features, Racket system can track the
 resource consumption (file handles, network ports, database connections, etc)
 of dynamically loaded code in a fine-grained fashion and, when such codes
 crash, the system can release the resources with a single instruction.</p><p>In sum, Racket is a full-spectrum language that is one of the first to
 implement a problem-facing programming strategy.</p></blockquote></blockquote><p class="Centertext"><span class="Legend"><span class="FigureTarget"><a name="(counter._(figure._a))" x-target-lift="Figure"></a>Figure&nbsp;1: </span>A Sample Description of a Favorite Language</span></p></blockquote><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft"><div class="nosearchform"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/4620-s15/8.html" title="backward to &quot;Extending Rust&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">&larr; prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="index.html" title="up to &quot;Building Extensible Systems&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="log.html" title="forward to &quot;Your Rust Log&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">next &rarr;</a></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div></body></html>
